Born in 801 (the 2nd year of King Aejang’s reign), he was an eighth-generation descendant of King Muyeol, and entered the monkhood at the age of 13 with the Buddhist name of Muyeom. In 821 (the 13th year of King Heondeok’s reign), he travelled to Tang China and achieved spiritual enlightenment through rigorous discipline. In 845 (the 7th year of King Munseong’s reign), he returned to Korea and became the head monk of Ohapsa Temple, which used to be located at Ungcheon (now Boryeong). As the temple came to prosper, the king gave it the name \"Seongjusa”. In 888 (the 2nd year of the reign of Queen Jinseong), Muyeom passed into Nirvana at Seongjusa Temple at the age of 89, and the queen bestowed upon him the posthumous name of Nanghye.The stele standing to the northwest of the temple site has a tortoise-shaped pedestal and a body topped with an ornamental capstone. The pedestal was seriously damaged and lay buried underground for many years, until it was discovered and repaired in 1974. The tortoise’s face is partly broken, and it has a round horn on its head, while the eyebrows are rolled into the eyes and the mouth seems to be exhaling fire. The tortoise shell features a clear double hexagonal design, with fairly thick cloud designs realistically expressed at the center. On the cloud designs, there is a square seat for resting the stele’s body, each side of which is decorated.The inscription is carved on the facade of the stele’s long body, and both corners of the upper part of the facade are cut round. The lower part of the capstone is decorated with lotus flower carvings, while a figure of entangled clouds and a dragon are carved in relief on its upper part. The carvings on the capstone brilliantly express the energetic fiery belch of a dragon and its magnificent spirit. On the front face, the dragon’s head is, interestingly, prominent in the same direction as the tortoise head of the pedestal. The inscription, which was composed by Choe Chi-won and calligraphed by his cousin Choe In-gon, contains a detailed description of the achievements of Buddhist monk Nanghye, and also states that Nanghye’s family originally belonged to the jingol (“true bone”) class of the royal family, but slid down to the middle of the “head rank six” class in his father’s generation. As such, the inscription is a very valuable material for studies of the class system during the Silla Period. The date of the stele’s establishment is not recorded in the inscription, but since it states that the monk’s stupa was built in 890 (the 4th year of the reign of Queen Jinseong), two years after Nanghye’s death, it is presumed that the stele was erected at the same time. The stele displays the beautiful carving skills so typical of the late Silla Period, making it one of the best – as well as the largest - of those produced during that period."

In 888 (the 2nd year of the reign of Queen Jinseong), Muyeom passed into Nirvana at Seongjusa Temple at the age of 89, and the queen bestowed upon him the posthumous name of Nanghye.The stele standing to the northwest of the temple site has a tortoise-shaped pedestal and a body topped with an ornamental capstone. The pedestal was seriously damaged and lay buried underground for many years, until it was discovered and repaired in 1974. The tortoise’s face is partly broken, and it has a round horn on its head, while the eyebrows are rolled into the eyes and the mouth seems to be exhaling fire. The tortoise shell features a clear double hexagonal design, with fairly thick cloud designs realistically expressed at the center. On the cloud designs, there is a square seat for resting the stele’s body, each side of which is decorated.The inscription is carved on the facade of the stele’s long body, and both corners of the upper part of the facade are cut round. The lower part of the capstone is decorated with lotus flower carvings, while a figure of entangled clouds and a dragon are carved in relief on its upper part. The carvings on the capstone brilliantly express the energetic fiery belch of a dragon and its magnificent spirit. On the front face, the dragon’s head is, interestingly, prominent in the same direction as the tortoise head of the pedestal. The inscription, which was composed by Choe Chi-won and calligraphed by his cousin Choe In-gon, contains a detailed description of the achievements of Buddhist monk Nanghye, and also states that Nanghye’s family originally belonged to the jingol (“true bone”) class of the royal family, but slid down to the middle of the “head rank six” class in his father’s generation. As such, the inscription is a very valuable material for studies of the class system during the Silla Period. The date of the stele’s establishment is not recorded in the inscription, but since it states that the monk’s stupa was built in 890 (the 4th year of the reign of Queen Jinseong), two years after Nanghye’s death, it is presumed that the stele was erected at the same time. The stele displays the beautiful carving skills so typical of the late Silla Period, making it one of the best – as well as the largest - of those produced during that period."

The upside-down shape of a large lotus flower is carved on the octagonal platform, and an hourglass-shaped post stands on the carving. In addition, a full-bloomed lotus flower is carved on the support stone on which the octagonal lantern niche with four openings rests. The large corner flower standing straight on the octagonal roofstone is outstanding. Since the head decoration remains as it was on the roofstone, the beauty becomes closer to perfection.This stone lantern is presumed to have been built sometime between 860 (the 4th year of King Heonan’s reign) and 873 (the 13th year of King Gyeongmun’s reign). The chief characteristic of this stone lantern is the hourglass-shaped center flower stone. The lantern forms a pleasant contrast with the dignified appearance of Gakhwangjeon Hall at the rear. Though it feels a little heavy, it exhibits the simple beauty of lotus flowers in full bloom and the grand beauty of the niche and roofstone, and as such is considered a representative work of the Unified Silla Period."

Considering the roofs of traditional Korean structures were usually repaired some 100-150 years after their construction, this hall dates back to the early 1200s and thus, is presumed to be the oldest wooden building remaining in Korea.The hall measures three kan (a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns) at the front and four kan at the sides, and has a gabled roof supported by column brackets. It has a door in the front middle compartment and windows on both sides. The interior of the hall, in which the Buddhist statue is placed, is decorated with an ornamental canopy, while the Buddhist altar is carved with a scroll design. Though built during the Goryeo Period, the hall displays the influence of the architectural style of the early Unified Silla Period."

Josadang Shrine is the place in which a well-known portrait of Uisang is enshrined.

        "context": "The Three-story Stone Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple and Dabotap Pagoda (National Treasure No. 20) stand to the west and east of the frontal area of the temple’s Daeungjeon Hall, respectively. The Three-story Stone Pagoda is also called Seokgatap (“Sakyamuni Buddha Pagoda”). The two pagodas were built at the same site to reflect the content of the Saddharmapundarika Sutra (The Lotus Sutra) in which the Dabo Buddha (“past Buddha”) stands beside Sakyamuni (“present Buddha”) to prove that his Buddhist sermon is right.The three-story body of this stone pagoda stands on a two-story platform, displaying the traditional style seen in the East and West Three-story Stone Pagodas at the Gameunsa Temple Site, Gyeongju (National Treasure No. 112) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at the Goseonsa Temple Site, Gyeongju (National Treasure No. 38). This style of stone pagoda reached its peak in the mid-8th century during the Unified Silla Period. The two-story platform was strong enough to sustain the full weight of the pagoda. Imitating the wooden construction style, the pagoda features stone pillar-shaped carvings at each corner of the upper and lower platform. Such carvings were also made on the pagoda’s body, and the corners of the roofstone are all raised, lending the pagoda an impression of lightness, as if ready to fly away.Although the platform and body of the pagoda are simply expressed without decoration, its upper extremity looks splendid. In fact, the original finial of this pagoda is assumed to have been lost sometime before the 16th century, and was only restored in 1973, imitating the ornamental finials of the East and West Three-story Stone Pagodas of Silsangsa Temple, Namwon (Treasure No. 37), which were made 100 years later than this pagoda. The pagoda is marked out, being surrounded by stones with lotus designs in every direction. It is separated to stand for the divine place for enshrining the Artifact of Buddha. The mark makes the pagoda look grander, being more or less unique to this pagoda and rarely seen elsewhere. The work looks very settled from any direction due to its excellent balance, and exudes simplicity and grandeur. Its construction can be loosely dated to shortly after the time when Bulguksa Temple became properly established as a temple, which, according to a record about the temple, was around 751. For many centuries the original structure was preserved in perfect condition, but, regrettably, it was damaged by robbers in September 1966. Afterwards, in December of the same year, the pagoda was perfectly reconstructed, leading to the discovery of a square space (in the front side of the second story of the pagoda’s body) containing Artifact associated with the Buddha. Various artifacts and reliquaries were found there, the most prominent of which was the Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra (National Treasure No. 126). Printed on mulberry paper, this sutra is the world’s oldest material printed by woodblocks.The pagoda is also known as Muyeongtap, literally meaning “a pagoda that casts no shadow.” This alternative name is related to the sorrowful legend of Asadal, a mason of Baekje who built Seokgatap Pagoda, and his wife Asanyeo. It is said that Asanyeo came to Seorabeol, the capital city of Silla, to meet her husband, but when she was unable to find him, she became desperate and drowned herself in a pond."

The Three-story Stone Pagoda is also called Seokgatap (“Sakyamuni Buddha Pagoda”). The two pagodas were built at the same site to reflect the content of the Saddharmapundarika Sutra (The Lotus Sutra) in which the Dabo Buddha (“past Buddha”) stands beside Sakyamuni (“present Buddha”) to prove that his Buddhist sermon is right.The three-story body of this stone pagoda stands on a two-story platform, displaying the traditional style seen in the East and West Three-story Stone Pagodas at the Gameunsa Temple Site, Gyeongju (National Treasure No. 112) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at the Goseonsa Temple Site, Gyeongju (National Treasure No. 38). This style of stone pagoda reached its peak in the mid-8th century during the Unified Silla Period. The two-story platform was strong enough to sustain the full weight of the pagoda. Imitating the wooden construction style, the pagoda features stone pillar-shaped carvings at each corner of the upper and lower platform. Such carvings were also made on the pagoda’s body, and the corners of the roofstone are all raised, lending the pagoda an impression of lightness, as if ready to fly away.Although the platform and body of the pagoda are simply expressed without decoration, its upper extremity looks splendid. In fact, the original finial of this pagoda is assumed to have been lost sometime before the 16th century, and was only restored in 1973, imitating the ornamental finials of the East and West Three-story Stone Pagodas of Silsangsa Temple, Namwon (Treasure No. 37), which were made 100 years later than this pagoda. The pagoda is marked out, being surrounded by stones with lotus designs in every direction. It is separated to stand for the divine place for enshrining the Artifact of Buddha. The mark makes the pagoda look grander, being more or less unique to this pagoda and rarely seen elsewhere. The work looks very settled from any direction due to its excellent balance, and exudes simplicity and grandeur. Its construction can be loosely dated to shortly after the time when Bulguksa Temple became properly established as a temple, which, according to a record about the temple, was around 751. For many centuries the original structure was preserved in perfect condition, but, regrettably, it was damaged by robbers in September 1966. Afterwards, in December of the same year, the pagoda was perfectly reconstructed, leading to the discovery of a square space (in the front side of the second story of the pagoda’s body) containing Artifact associated with the Buddha. Various artifacts and reliquaries were found there, the most prominent of which was the Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra (National Treasure No. 126). Printed on mulberry paper, this sutra is the world’s oldest material printed by woodblocks.The pagoda is also known as Muyeongtap, literally meaning “a pagoda that casts no shadow.” This alternative name is related to the sorrowful legend of Asadal, a mason of Baekje who built Seokgatap Pagoda, and his wife Asanyeo. It is said that Asanyeo came to Seorabeol, the capital city of Silla, to meet her husband, but when she was unable to find him, she became desperate and drowned herself in a pond."

The principal statue of Sakyamuni Buddha was placed at the center of the grotto, and forty statues of various bodhisattvas, Buddha’s disciples, and guardian kings were carved on the surrounding walls, though only thirty-eight of them remain. The rectangular front chamber of the grotto is connected to the round main chamber by a corridor. The exquisite ceiling of the main chamber was made with more than 360 flat stones. The architectural technique used to build this grotto is unprecedented in its excellence. There are statues of four guardian deities on both the left and right sides of the front chamber, which functions as the entrance to the main chamber. Carved on both sides of the entrance to the corridor is a statue of the Vajra Guardians, while the narrow corridor is decorated with the Four Guardian Kings carved in pairs. There is an octagonal stone column on both sides of the entrance to the round main chamber. The Principal Buddha is placed slightly off center toward the back of the main chamber. From the entrance, the walls of the chamber are filled with the images of two devas, two bodhisattvas, and ten arhats. Standing behind the Principal Buddha is a statue of the Eleven-faced Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, perhaps the most exquisitely carved statue found inside this grotto.Every single sculpture contained in the grotto may be considered a masterpiece of East Asian Buddhist art. The list of masterpieces includes the principal image of Buddha, which was created with mature carving skills; the Eleven-faced Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva with its magnificently carved face and body; statues of valiant warriors and the majestic Four Guardian Kings; and the supple graceful statues of various bodhisattvas and arhats, each of which displays a distinctive individuality. In particular, the serene appearance of the Principal Buddha enshrined in the main chamber deepens the mystical atmosphere. The extremely natural appearance of the Principal Buddha seems to present to all living people the ideal model of a man harboring a profound and sublime mind deep within him and easily pass to them his everlasting mercy. Seokguram Grotto is a masterpiece of the golden age of Buddhist art in Silla. What makes it stand out all the more is its perfect combination of architecture, mathematics, geometry, religion, and art. Seokguram Grotto has long been preserved as National Treasure No. 24, and was jointly registered as a UNESCO World Heritage in December 1995 along with Bulguksa Temple."

        "context": "This stele was erected in front of the Tomb of King Taejong Muyeol, the 29th ruler of Silla, in 661 (the 1st year of King Munmu’s reign). The inscription was calligraphed by Kim In-mun, who was the second son of the deceased king and a well-known master calligrapher. Steles built during the Unified Silla Period were influenced by the Tang Dynasty of China, and usually consisted of a tortoise-shaped pedestal and an ornamental capstone in the form of a dragon. The Stele for King Taejong Muyeol was the first monument to display such a style. At present, the whereabouts of the stele’s body is unknown, and only the tortoise-shaped pedestal and the capstone are housed in a pavilion. The tortoise of the pedestal extends its head high upward and its legs forward. There are large honeycomb-shaped hexagonal carvings on its back, and lotus designs are carved around the stele’s seat. The ornamental capstone is carved with three dragons on the left and three on the right, which coiled around each other to form a support for a “magic pearl.” The Chinese characters inscribed at the center of the front side clearly state for whom the stele was established. The tortoise-shaped pedestal and the capstone display realistic and vital expressions, suggesting the energetic spirit of the Silla people, who succeeded in unifying the three kingdoms. This stele is regarded as one of the finest masterpieces not only of Korea but also of Asia, thanks to the outstanding stone carving skills of that time."

It is the oldest astronomical observatory in Asia and is widely regarded as a precious cultural heritage that gives us a clear idea of the level of technological development of that time.Standing approximately 9 m in height, this observatory consists of a cylindrical body, a platform, and a square top. The cylindrical body includes 27 layers of fan-shaped stones, and the outer face is trimmed smooth whereas the interior wall face is not even. At the upper part, long ends of stone material that is geared into inside part of hash shape are extended to the outside. This arrangement can be seen in layers 19-20 and 25-26, and so it is assumed that a ladder was easily placed easy on those steps in the inside. Around the southeast opening, the lower part is filled with rubble, while the upper part to the top is open and hollow. The eastern half of the uppermost step is blocked with a stone slab. It is presumed that there might have been some devices for observation inside the observatory. The record of an ancient book states, “People can climb up through its middle.” It seems that one simply placed a ladder on its outside and climbed inside through a window, and then climbed up to the top via another ladder to observe the stars. One researcher has suggested that the top might have been very convenient to sit, stand or lie on. During the ancient period, astronomy was deeply related to agriculture as farming times were often determined according to the movements of the stars. It was also deeply related to politics in that the horoscope was considered to be important, since the good or bad fortune of a nation could be predicted according to the results of their observation of the stars."

During the ancient period, astronomy was deeply related to agriculture as farming times were often determined according to the movements of the stars.

According to an investigation conducted under the Japanese Imperial Regime, the number of woodblocks reached up to 81,258, including some re-carved blocks that were added in the Joseon Dynasty. Each wood block weighs around 3 to 4 kilograms and measures 70 cm in width and 24 cm in length, although their thickness varies from 2.6 to 4 cm.

Unlike other monuments erected in commemoration of his royal tour, this one does not carry the title sunsu gwangyeong, meaning “The king conducted an inspection around the border area,” but it does contain a list of the members of the king’s entourage. At that time, Bitbeol Gaya was located at an important spot to provide Silla with strategic advantages in advancing toward the west. Accordingly, it was incorporated into Silla’s territory in 555 (the 16th year of King Jinheung’s reign). King Jinheung embarked on a royal inspection of the area, which was incorporated with Daeyaju (present-day Hapcheon) and named Bisabeol-gun or Bijahwa-gun in 565. The monument has the common style of those made in the Silla Period. The front face of a natural stone was evenly trimmed and carved with inscriptions, and is marked with a line around the edge. The front part of the epitaph is so worn that the inscription is no longer legible. However, given the contents of the inscriptions on other similar monuments, the inscription on this one may well have referred to the occupation of Bitbeol Gaya and the policy of territorial expansion pursued by King Jinheung, his ruling philosophy and ambitions, and so on. The latter part is clear on the whole, with the list of the king’s entourage recorded in the order of the official post and position occupied by its members. In particular, this list sheds light on the provincial administrative organization, social ranks, and social systems of that time. The date of construction of the monument is given as 561 (the 22nd year of King Jinheung’s reign), i.e. one year before the fall of Dae Gaya.

Unlike other monuments erected in commemoration of his royal tour, this one does not carry the title sunsu gwangyeong, meaning “The king conducted an inspection around the border area,” but it does contain a list of the members of the king’s entourage. At that time, Bitbeol Gaya was located at an important spot to provide Silla with strategic advantages in advancing toward the west. Accordingly, it was incorporated into Silla’s territory in 555 (the 16th year of King Jinheung’s reign). King Jinheung embarked on a royal inspection of the area, which was incorporated with Daeyaju (present-day Hapcheon) and named Bisabeol-gun or Bijahwa-gun in 565. The monument has the common style of those made in the Silla Period. The front face of a natural stone was evenly trimmed and carved with inscriptions, and is marked with a line around the edge. The front part of the epitaph is so worn that the inscription is no longer legible. However, given the contents of the inscriptions on other similar monuments, the inscription on this one may well have referred to the occupation of Bitbeol Gaya and the policy of territorial expansion pursued by King Jinheung, his ruling philosophy and ambitions, and so on. The latter part is clear on the whole, with the list of the king’s entourage recorded in the order of the official post and position occupied by its members. In particular, this list sheds light on the provincial administrative organization, social ranks, and social systems of that time. The date of construction of the monument is given as 561 (the 22nd year of King Jinheung’s reign), i.e. one year before the fall of Dae Gaya. It suggests that King Jinheung had the political intention of making the area a stepping stone of his advance into Gaya territory. Also, since the monument contains a record of principal events during the reign of King Jinheung, it complements the corresponding article in Samguk sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), and is of great help in piecing together and understanding the historical facts."

        "context": "After the death of King Sinmun of Unified Silla, his son King Hyoso built this pagoda in 692 to pray for the repose of his deceased father’s soul. After the death of King Hyoso, his successor King Seongdeok placed sarira and Buddhist statues for the two previous kings in the pagoda, and prayed for the prosperity and peace of his kingdom. It is a typical stone pagoda of the Silla Period, consisting of a three-story body erected on a two-story platform. It is smaller than the East and West Three-story Stone Pagodas at Gameunsa Temple Site (National Treasure No. 112) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda from Goseonsa Temple Site (National Treasure No. 38). The style of the platform is similar to that of the two aforementioned pagodas, but it shows signs of a change in the style of stone pagodas which saw the number of inner pillars of the first-story platform reduced from 3 to 2, while the main body and roof stones were each made of a single stone, rather than of several stones. The four corners of the roof stone are slightly raised to create a light appearance, and the roof supports consist of five layers. Only the base of the finial ornamentation remains on the top of the pagoda.

Although the first story is huge, the pagoda tapers sharply from the second story upward. The main body of the first story has a square stone pillar at each of its four corners, with auxiliary pillars erected inside the four pillars to create an opening. The roofstones and their supports are all made of different stones, and their corners are raised to create a light impression. Only the base of pagoda finial remains of the upper extremity of the pagoda. As well as having thirteen stories, this pagoda is unique for the air of stability created by highlighting its first story and gradually reducing its size from the second story. The platform also departs from the common style. Thanks to these unique characteristics, the pagoda is a precious resource for studies of stone pagodas of the Unified Silla Period."

        "context": "In Buddhist tradition, a flagpole was used to hoist a huge flag or banner called dang at the entrance to a temple during an important event such as a ceremonial ritual. The site at Nammun-ro, Sangdang-gu in Cheongju, where this iron flagpole stands, was originally occupied by Yongdusa Temple, which was founded in 962 (the 13th year of the reign of King Gwangjong of the Goryeo Dynasty). Sadly, the temple was destroyed as a result of the frequent warfare and political turmoil of the late Goryeo Period. The flagpole, however, has been preserved in its original form complete with its pedestal and flagpole supports. Nowadays, this area is one of the busiest areas in the city.The two supports feature protruding vertical lines in the middle of the outer face, creating some variation on the otherwise plain surface. Between the two supports, there are twenty cylindrical iron tubes geared into each other and a fastening device like a crossbar at the top of the supports which served to firmly fasten the flagpole. Notably, there is an inscription on the surface of the third iron tub which explains the purpose and process of establishment of this flagpole. According to the inscription, the flagpole originally consisted of thirty iron tubs, and was erected at the time of the temple’s construction in 962. It is considered a precious heritage as its production date has been clearly identified, and it is one of only three remaining flagpole in Korea, along with those at Gapsa Temple in Gongju and Chiljangsa Temple in Anseong.According to a local legend associated with this flagpole, the people in Cheongju had suffered numerous disasters caused by flooding ever since ancient times. One day, however, a fortune-teller said that the people of Cheongju would be able to avoid disaster if they built a large mast, because the area would assume a ship-like shape. After all, the area actually avoided disaster by building a flagpole like a mast, and Cheongju came to be named Juseong (meaning ‘Ship Town’)."

Both pagodas are topped with finials each consisting of a group of symbolic ornamental objects.The stone lantern also exhibits a typical style of Silla lanterns consisting of a square base, two lotus-carved octagonal stones connected by a long, comparatively slender pillar, an octagonal light chamber with four windows, a wide roofstone with floral ornaments at the ends of the hip rafters, and the finial of several symbolic decorative objects.These two stone pagodas and one stone lantern are in their original good condition complete with the finial, serving as a rare source of knowledge for the Buddhist art of Silla. A document discovered at one of the pagodas revealed that they were erected around 870 when Silla was under the rule of King Gyeongmun (r. 861-875).

The statue is the oldest and largest of all Buddha statues made by the technique of forming an image by putting clay paste onto a wooden framework.The statue features a plump face with thick lips and pointed nose, creating a rather grave expression. The robe is draped from the left shoulder, thereby exposing the right shoulder; it has many parallel folds as it covers the knees. The technique of expressing the robe folds is very similar to that used for the Iron Seated Vairocana of Dopiansa Temple (National Treasure No. 63), suggesting that this clay Buddha was also made during the early Goryeo Period (918~1392).The Buddha exhibits a symbolic hand gesture of touching the earth with his right hand, revealing the intention of Shakyamuni to fight against the demon Mara. Still, the fact that the statue is enshrined in Geungnakjeon, or Hall of Supreme Bliss -- a Buddhist paradise ruled by Amitabha Buddha -- and a record engraved on State Preceptor Wonyung’s Monument of Buseoksa Temple, indicating that the temple enshrined an Amitabha image, show that this Buddha is Amitabha. The hands of the current statue exhibiting a demon-expelling gesture are believed to have been made during the Joseon Period when it was repaired.Behind the Buddha’s body and head are halos made separately of wood and decorated with flame patterns along the edge to represent the holy radiance emanating from Buddha. The halos are circular in shape and heavily adorned with floral designs, with traces showing that miniature Buddhas had been attached to them.The grave rather than benign look and the parallel folds of the robe display stylized aspects; still, the fact that it is a rare clay statue made by exploiting elaborate sculptural techniques gives it considerable historical and cultural value. The elements, which still vividly show the influence of the Unified Silla, reveal that it was a work of the early Goryeo Period."

The paintings have been damaged to a rather considerable extent, losing much of its original condition due to repainting by later generations; nonetheless, the remaining dynamic brush strokes provide valuable clues to an outstanding artistic achievement made in Korean Buddhist painting during the Goryeo Period (918~1392).An old record discovered at the shrine revealed that it was built in 1377, suggesting that the paintings were also produced around that same year. These works are known as the oldest existing Buddhist murals and are accordingly regarded as important assets in connection with Korean art history."

        "context": "This stele, standing at the precincts of Ssanggyesa Temple in Hadong, was built to honor the life and achievement of Master Jingam (774-850), an eminent Unified Silla Monk who introduced and spread the Buddhist musical heritage called “Brahma Chants” to Korea. He left his country in 804 for Tang where he studied Buddhism and got ordained as a monk. Returning home in 830, he was widely respected by Silla kings for his distinguished spiritual and ethical leadership until he died at Ssanggyesa Temple at the age of 77.Despite its damaged body, the stele is complete with the dragon capstone and tortoise pedestal in their original condition. The pedestal exhibits the style established during the late Unified Silla Period (676-935) marked by a dragon head, a tortoise back, and a large rectangular hole at the center holding the body of the stele as well as cloud designs on four sides. The capstone is carved with two dragons contending with each other over a magic pearl, with a finial consisting of a globe and a basin of upturned lotus petals holding it. On the front face of the body is an inscription of the stele’s name, “Stele for Master Jingam in the Eastern Country.”The stele was set up in 887 after the name of the temple where he was based was changed from Okcheonsa to Ssanggyesa. The lengthy epitaph engraved on the body was composed and calligraphed by Choe Chi-won (857-?), one of the greatest men of letters in Unified Silla, and is widely admired by today’s art historians for the vitality and natural beauty of the brush strokes."

It is a building with three kan (a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns) on the front and back and four kan on the sides featuring gable roof, decorative brackets placed on top of the columns, triple three-panel lattice-window doors on the front, two windows on both sides at the rear, and plank door at the center.As a Goryeo building built under the influence of the architectural heritage of Baekje, the Daeungjeon Hall of Sudeoksa Temple is widely praised for its architectural beauty particularly the decorative elements on both sides. In addition to its fine structural merit and beauty, it is also a rare traditional architectural work whose date of construction is clearly recorded, making it a very important part of the Korean architectural heritage."

Undergoing major renovation in 1457, the buildings were rebuilt in 1488 under the supervision of Buddhist Monk Hakjo and with the support of the royal family and named Boandang. Their location in a remote mountainous area helped the buildings remain safe during the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592 and maintain their original structures. Records show that the depositories underwent two more renovation works in 1622 and 1624.The two buildings, each with 15 bays on the front and 2 bays on the sides, stand side by side, one (called Sudarajang Depository) in the south and the other (Beopbojeon Hall) in the north. There are two small book storages in the east and west; thus forming a rectangular courtyard with the woodblock depositories. The buildings are designed such that they could best fulfill their functions as depositories of woodblocks; thus, all the extra decorative elements were removed. Each depository has two rows of windows in different sizes -- one on the front and the other on the rear -- designed to ensure effective natural ventilation. The earthen floor is laid over layers of powdered charcoal, lime, salt, and sand; thus effectively controlling moisture in a natural manner.Experts believe that these depositories have been able to exploit the natural condition surrounding them in a creative manner to provide scientifically effective condition for the preservation of the Tripitaka Koreana woodblocks for such a long period. These 15th century buildings are the world’s only structures built for the storage of Tripitaka printing woodblocks whose cultural uniqueness and value landed them in UNESCO’s list of world heritage sites."

        "context": "Palsangjeon Wooden Pagoda is the only wooden pagoda in Korea, which was built before the modern period and still stands in the precincts of Beopjusa Temple. The temple was established in 553 by a Silla monk named Uisin who had studied Buddhism in India. The current pagoda, a five-story structure, was erected after the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592 and rebuilt after being dismantled in 1968. The name of the pagoda, which literally means “Hall of Eight Phases,” came from the hanging paintings depicting the eight important phases in the life of Shakyamuni Buddha. The first and second stories of the pagoda feature five kan (a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns) on all four sides, and the third and fourth stories, three kan; the fifth story has two kan. The wooden structure is set up on a stone base that is comfortably low, with four staircases one on each side. The pagoda is covered with a pyramidal roof with a finial on top.

He returned home with his compatriot, State Preceptor Beomil, in 847, settled in Pungaksan Mountain, and later moved to Hwasun where he built a temple that he named Ssangbongsa based on his pen-name, which literally means “twin mountains.” When he died at the temple at the age of 71, King Gyeongmun (r. 861-875) of the Unified Silla Period awarded him the posthumous honorary title Cheolgam in recognition of his service and had his stupa and accompanying memorial stele built. The monument shows a typical feature of the octagonal stupas developed in Silla, although the finial is missing. The base consists of three parts -- lower, middle, and upper stones -- heavily decorated with carvings. Consisting of double tiers, the lower stone is elaborately carved with lions seated in different postures on clouds, all facing the front. The upper stone is also composed of double tiers wherein the lower tier is carved with lotus petals and the upper tier, with Kalavinkas, birds from the Land of Supreme Bliss, playing musical instruments. The main body of the stupa enshrining the relics of the monk is carved with eight round pillars in the corners and eight faces containing doors, Four Guardian Kings, and several apsaras carved in relief. The roof stone also boasts of excellent artisanship, with the sculptor paying careful attention to the correct rendering of the minute details including the furrows and ridges of tiled roof, decorative end tiles, and rafters underneath the eaves. The stupa is believed to have been erected in 868, the same year the monk died. The outstanding artistic skills, combined with the artist’s religious piety as delivered through this work of stonemasonry, makes it one of the greatest stone stupas made during the period."

The Buddha features a topknot (usnisa), a round, graceful face, and a stout, imposing body, but the lack of volume suggests that it was made in the late 9th century. He also has the fingers of his right hand pointing to the ground and his left hand placed on his lap. It is said that there had originally been a medicine jar on the left hand but is now missing. The robe is loosely draped from the left shoulder, exposing the right shoulder and creating many folds as it covers the Buddha’s lower body. The rectangular pedestal is roughly divided into three parts; the lower part is tall and large, whereas the middle and upper parts are comparatively low and small. The base is conspicuously wide with postholes on all four corners, suggesting that the statue was originally protected by a canopy or housed in a shrine. Carved with lotus petals, the lower part of the pedestal has floral carvings of considerable size on all four corners, whereas the cubic middle part has two “elephant eyes” carved on each of its four faces and the upper part carved with a lotus flower in full bloom. Art historians believe that the statue originally had a stone halo that was replaced by the current wooden halo during the Joseon Period (1392-1910). The halo consists of two parts -- the inner part decorated with a floral design and the outer part with a flame design – suggesting that it copied the halos that were the trend during the period between the late Unified Silla (676-935) and early Goryeo Periods (918-1392). The cast iron Bhaisajyaguru in Janggoksa Temple is a masterpiece of the early 10th-century Buddhist sculpture and is particularly regarded highly for the distinctive pagoda-shaped pedestal, design intended to have its own shrine, and style of cast iron statues established in the late 9th century."

The temple’s Mireukjeon Hall was burnt down amid the turbulence caused by the second invasion of Korea (then Joseon) by the Japanese in 1597, rebuilt in 1635, and subjected to several repair works since then until it achieved its present appearance. This hall, which enshrines a large statue of Maitreya Buddha, has many different names such as Yonghwajeon (“Hall of Dragon Flowers”), Sanhojeon (“Hall of Ten Thousand Years”), and Jangnyukjeon (“Hall of Sixteen-Foot Tall Buddha”); its name plaques are hung under the front eaves of each story: Daejabojeon (“Hall of Great Mercy and Treasure”) for the first, Yonghwajihoe (“Assembly of Dragon Flower”) for the second, and Mireukjeon (“Hall of Maitreya”). The first and second stories of the building feature a structure of five kan (a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns) on the front and four kan on the sides; on the third story, one of the three kan is on the front, with the two kan on the sides. The entire structure is covered by a gabled-and-hipped roof supported by decorative brackets put not just on top of the columns but also between every two columns. The four corners of each roof are supported by slender additional posts. While the building is outwardly three-storied, it has a single large hall in its interior. Interestingly, the tallest column in the hall is made not of a single solid piece of wood but by combining several pieces. Its majestic appearance combined with architectural stability makes Mireukjeon Hall one of the most admired historical wooden buildings in Korea today."

The statue disappeared on its way to the intended destination, however, only to be found at an unknown site in Hwagaesan Mountain. Doseon decided to respect the Buddha’s choice, built Dopiansa Temple at the site, and enshrined the statue in it. The Vairocana statue of Dopiansa Temple is one of the many cast iron statues produced extensively across Korea between the late Unified Silla and early Goryeo Periods. What makes it more special is that it is seated on a pedestal that is also cast iron. The Buddha features conch-shaped hair and pleasantly oval, benign face, wearing a robe covering both shoulders with folds expressed in a rather stylized manner. The symbolic hand gesture wherein the right hand envelops the index finger of the left hand also shows that he is Vairocana Buddha. The pedestal on which the statue is seated consists of three tiers, with the upper and lower tiers carved with lotus petals and the middle in octagonal form; thus exhibiting the most popular style for the Buddhist statue pedestals made during the period. On the back of the statue is an inscription showing that it was made in 865.

The bottle also displays inlaid peony blossom designs on the opposite sides of a long neck, slender, octagonal spout rising above it, and another spout attached to the shoulder designed to be used to fill the bottle with water. The latter spout originally had a matching cover that is now missing. The bottle is highly praised among art historians for the creative inlaying technique used for surface decoration as well as the elegant body made with extremely fine-grained clay and clear jade-green glaze coating it."

Sim Ji-baek was one of the 74 recipients of the title to whom prizes were also granted, i.e., 15 hectares of land for each.

The printing quality of the document is rather poor, largely due to the unevenness in typesetting and the size of types; nonetheless, it is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of materials printed during the early Joseon by using wooden movable types and is consequently a very valuable part of the heritage with respect to the development of wooden movable-type printing in Korea."

The principal Buddha at the center is marked by comparatively large topknot, face slightly bent downward with a benign smile, and shapely but somewhat narrow shoulders. The robe is draped down from both shoulders, creating V-shaped folds on the front of the body and spreading out at the bottom like wings. His symbolic hand gesture has the right palm turned forward with fingers turned upward and the left palm also turned forward, with fingers -- two of which are bent -- turned downward. His acolytes are in bejeweled crowns with three ornamental erections and are depicted as if they are hung on the low corners of the mandorla. They have an appearance similar to that of the principal Buddha but X-shaped, rather than V-shaped, robe folds and make different hand gestures. The boat-shaped mandorla is covered with the flame motif expressed with fine lines, with two halos -- one around the head and the other around the body of the principal figure -- carved in low relief and further ornamented with lotus, vine, and honeysuckle designs. The pedestal is tubular, covered with down-turned lotus petals and set up on a disk-like base. The triad shares stylistic similarities with the Gilt-bronze Standing Buddha Triad with Inscription of \"Sinmyo Year\" (National Treasure No. 85), displaying the characteristics of the Chinese Buddhist sculpture developed during the period of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589 AD).

The shrine of this type tended to feature the shape of a house built by carving wood, metal, or even stone. Today, it provides important clues about the Korean architectural styles in the past. This particular shrine, 18 centimeters high and made of gilt-bronze, was made to treasure a tiny Buddha triad, also made of bronze and gilt. Originally placed on a rectangular altar with handrails in the shrine, the triad consists of the principal Buddha seated in the middle with two acolytes standing on either side. The shrine features the shape of a Buddhist prayer hall complete with columns, roof with ornaments, and three windows -- one in the front and the other two on both sides -- through which one can have a clear view of the sacred images enshrined in it. The principal Buddha is marked by a rather stylized face, with the dharma robe covering both shoulders and having folds expressed by simple lines; behind him are glorious head and body lights edged with flame patterns. The two bodhisattvas flanking the Buddha display stylistic and technical similarities, but they wear beaded ornamental headgears. The shrine is substantially preserved in original condition, still retaining the gilt walls and green-rusted roof. The Buddha’s long waist, robe folds expressed rather haphazardly, and beaded crowns worn by bodhisattvas suggest that the statuettes were made under the influence of the north of the Korean Peninsula in the 11th and 12th centuries. Today, the triad and the shrine provide valuable information on the traditional style of Korean architecture and carving techniques developed during or before the Goryeo Period (918-1392)."

The curve between the bowl and the tubular stem in the middle and the ledge made along the circular foot contribute to the increased sense of stability. The 1:1 ratio between height and width also realizes outstanding balance and proportion.

All these fine decorative motifs combined with the near perfect form of the censer are considered a clear example of the outstanding achievements made by Goryeo artisans in metal craft and the art of silver inlaying. Inside the rim is a silver-inlaid inscription of 57 characters stating that the incense burner was made in 1177, showing that it is the oldest existing censer of this type.

        "context": "This bronze incense burner of Pyochungsa Temple in Miryang, Gyeongsangnam-do has height of 27.5 centimeters and mouth dimension of 26.1 centimeters. The censer is lavishly decorated with inlaid silver designs. The incense burner exhibits the typical style of Goryeo incense burners, consisting of a semispherical body with wide rim and a tubular stem on a flared circular base. The curve between the bowl and the tubular stem in the middle and the ledge made along the circular foot contribute to the increased sense of stability. The 1:1 ratio between height and width also realizes outstanding balance and proportion. On the upper surface of the rim are six silver-inlaid circles arranged at equal distances from each other, each containing a Brahmic script -- also silver-inlaid -- and cloud motifs in between. On the outer surface of the body are four more Brahmic scripts, all contained in circles and there are cloud and dragon motifs on the foot. All these fine decorative motifs combined with the near perfect form of the censer are considered a clear example of the outstanding achievements made by Goryeo artisans in metal craft and the art of silver inlaying. Inside the rim is a silver-inlaid inscription of 57 characters stating that the incense burner was made in 1177, showing that it is the oldest existing censer of this type. Another inscription remaining inside the foot shows that it was made for Yongheungsa Temple in Changnyeong, but no one knows how it arrived in Pyochungsa Temple."

It was in 1576 when he was 32 years old that Yi Sun-sin passed the state military examination and started his public career as a low-ranking military official. While Yi was a potent military leader, he was also a talented man of letters and faithful Confucian follower devoted to its virtues such as loyalty and filial piety. Also a capable military strategist and a man of foresight, he foresaw the Japanese invasion while he was serving as a Naval Commander-in-chief for West Jeolla-do and led systematic preparations for war by building battleships and increasing military exercises. With Japan invading Korea in 1592, his meticulous preparations paid off with great historic victories at the battles that ensued one after another at the seas off Okpo (1592), Danghangpo (1592), Hansando (1592), Myeongnyang (1597), and Noryang (1598). After the war, which ended with his heroic death, he was honored with posthumous honorary titles including First-Grade Meritorious Subject of Seonmu (“Bountiful Warrior”) and Chungmu (“Loyal Warrior”). Possessing self-sacrificial patriotism, noble character, and outstanding leadership, Yi Sun-sin played a crucial role in saving Korea from one of its formidable foreign enemies, earning admiration nationwide as one of the greatest heroes in Korean history. The collection consists of seven books titled Imjin Ilgi (“Imjin Year Diary,” 54 pages, from the 5th month in 1592 to the 3rd month the following year), Gyesa Ilgi (“Gyesa Year Diary,” 60 pages, from the 5th month to the 9th month in 1593), Gabo Ilgi (“Gabo Year Diary,” 104 pages, from the 1st to the 7th month in 1594), Byeongsin Ilgi (“Byeongsin Year Diary,” 82 pages, from the 1st to the 10th month in 1596), Jeongyu Ilgi (“Jeongyu Year Diary,” 54 pages, from the 4th to the 10th month in 1597), Jeongyu Ilgi-sok (“Annex to the Jeongyu Year Diary,” 40 pages, from the 8th month in 1597 to the 1st month in 1598), and Musul Ilgi (“Musul Year Diary,” 16 pages, from the 9th to the 10th month in 1598). Yi Sun-sin’s war diaries have been kept by his descendants and were used as a source material for the “War Diary” (Nanjung Ilgi) contained in The Collected Writings by the Loyal Warrior (Chungmugong Jeonseo) published in 1795. The diaries contain valuable information about the military strategies and tactics used by the naval forces during the mid-Joseon period as well as the drafts of the reports sent to the king on the military situations during the Imjin Waeran (Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592)."

        "context": "This five-story stone pagoda located in Tamni-ri, Uiseong was built during the Unified Silla Period (676-935). It is characterized by a low, single-tier base supporting the main five-storied structure exhibiting a unique style achieved by combining the styles of brick pagodas and wooden architectural works. The base consists of a foundation of hewn rectangular stones on which, imitating a wooden architectural structure, middle and corner columns made from separate stone blocks are erected. As for the pagoda’s main body, the first story is significantly taller than the other stories, and it has a niche where one or more Buddha statues were enshrined. From the second story up, the bodies of the pagoda grow notably shorter. The roof of each story is stepped on by both under and upper sides as in brick pagodas. The cornice under the eaves is five-stepped, whereas the upper part is six-stepped. The roof stones are slightly upturned at the corners, patterned after the tile roof of a wooden building. Along with the Stone Brick Pagoda of Bunhwangsa Temple, Gyeongju (National Treasure No. 30), this pagoda is of great importance in studying the development of pagodas in Korea with its unique form and style."

        "context": "This 80-centimeter high gilt-bronze pensive Maitreya Bodhisattva is seated on a stool-like pedestal with his right leg crossed over his left, the fingers of his right hand gently touching his cheek. It was acquired by a Japanese collector in 1912 and donated to the Japanese Government-General of Joseon before being turned over to its museum in 1916. Currently, the statue is on display at the National Museum of Korea. The bodhisattva is wearing a lavishly decorated headgear from which two strands are drawn over to both shoulders. He has a rather squarely, plump face wearing a benign smile and a sleek, imposing body with slender limbs and comparatively large hands and feet, all of which highlight his elegant physical appearance. He is clothed in a celestial veil robe that covers both shoulders before being draped down to cover the knees. The lower garment, made of a rather thick fabric, has many U-shaped folds exhibiting excellent workmanship. The oval pedestal on which the bodhisattva places his left leg is decorated with a lotus motif, but the mandorla (Buddhist halo of light) is missing. An X-ray inspection carried out in 1963 revealed that it has no trace of defect or repair either inside or out, and that it was made of a rare material using unique techniques. Art historians believe, based on the statue’s balanced physique, beautifully rendered robe folds, and pensive look, that it was made in the mid- or late 6th century during which the Korean style of bodhisattva images emerged."

According to an inscription engraved at the sarira reliquary, a gold Amitabha statuette was put in it in 706, leading some historians to believe that this is that Amitabha. Some raise doubts since the Amitabha is six inches tall according to the inscription, whereas the height of this seated Buddha is only 12.2 centimeters or shorter than four inches. The statuette largely consists of three parts -- the mandorla (Buddhist halo of light), Buddha’s body, and the lotus pedestal -- designed to be detached from each other. The Buddha has notably large topknot, benign face with clearly defined features on it, and broad shoulders, displaying an image closer to that deemed ideal by Unified Silla artisans. It also has the outer robe covering both shoulders and running down while leaving the breast open to show the inner wear and cover the knees, finally hanging down further to create many vertical folds arranged to form symmetry. As for the symbolic hand gesture, the right hand is raised to the same level as the shoulders with the palm facing forward; the left hand placed on the knee shows the fingers turned downward and the palm facing away from the viewer. The mandorla formed around the head is decorated with a lotus flower surrounded by honeysuckle and vine designs and finally edged with an openwork flame motif; that around the body features honeysuckle and vine designs also edged with openwork flame motif. The pedestal has a tubular stem with a base of overturned lotus petals. With the face wearing a benign smile and having clear-cut features, balanced body, symbolic hand gesture, style of robe folds, and volume-focused expressions, this Buddha statuette is regarded as a very valuable source for the study of Korean Buddhist sculpture in the early 8th century."

The Buddha is standing on its own gold pedestal with a golden mandorla (Buddhist halo of light) set behind the head. The Buddha is marked by a notably large topknot (usnisa) and an oval face wearing a merciful smile. He has high, shapely nose and eyes looking ahead pensively. He is clothed in a rather thick robe that covers both shoulders and drapes down to create several U-shaped folds in front with the bottom edge flaring out, revealing the influence from the Buddhist statues of the Three Kingdoms Period (57 BC – 668). He has the right hand raised to turn the palm outward and the left hand to hold the robe. The mandorla symbolizing the glory emanating from the Buddha’s head is circular, consisting of a lotus flower motif at the center and three concentric circles with spokes representing the spreading rays of light. It is then encircled by an openwork flame design, eventually forming an onion shape. The pedestal, made separately before being fitted to the Buddha’s feet, is shaped like an overturned lotus blossom put on a double-tier base. Experts believe -- from the physical proportion and the shape of robe folds -- that the statuette is a work of early Unified Silla (676-935). An inscription discovered at the sarira container where it had been stored strongly suggests that it was made before 692 when the container was enshrined in the pagoda built that year.

Both stone statues are now stored in the National Museum of Korea in Seoul. This Maitreya statue is characterized by the lavishly decorated headgear that it wears and the attractively plump face wearing a benign expression. He is also wearing two luxurious beaded necklaces and a third beaded ornament draped from the neck further down to the legs. The robe is draped from the left shoulder, leaving the right bare, to cover the right arm before being drawn further downward; the skirt, worn with a beaded belt, runs downward to cover the ankles. Behind the bodhisattva is a mandorla representing the rays of light spreading from his head and body and which is edged with a flame motif. The pedestal on which the bodhisattva stands consists of a double-tier lotus base put on an octagonal foundation, all of which are carved with a single stone block. Behind the mandorla is an inscription showing that the bodhisattva was carved in 719 when Silla was under the rule of King Seongdeok. The technique of rendering the bodhisattva’s voluminous body suggests that the Silla artisans during this period were under the influence of the interregional trend of their time."

The Amitabha statue features a plump face with imposing body covered with a rather thick robe depicted with abundant U-shaped folds. The almond-shaped mandorla behind the Buddha contains two halos -- one around the head and the other spanning the entire body -- divided by three lines and edged by a flame motif.

His outfit is complete with a fabric sash around the waist and is draped down with a jade disk chained in the middle. There is a peg behind the head, showing that the deity once had a mandorla (Buddhist halo of light). With the simple, balanced body, realistic rendering of the veil skirt and fabric pedestal cover, and elaborately carved facial features, the statue is widely regarded as a clear example of advanced metal molding techniques. The dim, blissful smile on the face also contributes to its reputation as a great masterpiece representing the artistic achievement of Korean Buddhist sculpture.

The triad has been admiringly dubbed “Smile of Baekje” and is comparatively better preserved than other contemporary rock-carved images thanks to its location, i.e., under a ledge. The principal Buddha of the triad, standing on a lotus pedestal, features a plump face with lunate eyebrows as well as almond-shaped eyes, flat and wide nose, and smiling lips, all contributing to the creation of a benign look characterizing the Buddhist images of an ancient Korean kingdom, Baekje (18BC-660). His body is covered with a thick robe creating several U-shaped folds in front; around the head is a lotus halo enclosed by a flaming mandorla. A bodhisattva standing on his right side also has a face with chubby cheeks full of benign smile and wears a bejeweled crown. He wears nothing on his upper body except the ornamentation around his neck and on both shoulders, but the skirt-like lower garment is draped down to cover the feet. The other bodhisattva seated in meditation pose on the Buddha’s left side also has a plump, smiling face. The deity has both arms severely damaged, but the elaborate rendering of his posture with his right leg crossing the left -- which is pendent -- the left hand laid gently over the right ankle and the fingers of the right hand touching the right cheek, exhibits the excellent workmanship of the artist who carved him. This triad, which is unique since it includes a pensive bodhisattva, is believed to have depicted the three Buddhist deities -- Shakyamuni, Maitreya, and Dipankara -- who appear together in the Avatamsaka Sutra. Art historians conjecture -- from the deities’ chubby, cheerful faces and other details as well as the principal Buddha’s imposing figure -- that it was carved between the late 6th and early 7th centuries. As suggested by its location in the area between Taean Peninsula and Buyeo, which had been a key strategic area linking Baekje southwest of the Korean Peninsula with the eastern coast of China, the triad is considered tangible evidence of the active cultural exchange between the two East Asian regions during the period when it was carved."

A bodhisattva standing on his right side also has a face with chubby cheeks full of benign smile and wears a bejeweled crown. He wears nothing on his upper body except the ornamentation around his neck and on both shoulders, but the skirt-like lower garment is draped down to cover the feet. The other bodhisattva seated in meditation pose on the Buddha’s left side also has a plump, smiling face. The deity has both arms severely damaged, but the elaborate rendering of his posture with his right leg crossing the left -- which is pendent -- the left hand laid gently over the right ankle and the fingers of the right hand touching the right cheek, exhibits the excellent workmanship of the artist who carved him. This triad, which is unique since it includes a pensive bodhisattva, is believed to have depicted the three Buddhist deities -- Shakyamuni, Maitreya, and Dipankara -- who appear together in the Avatamsaka Sutra. Art historians conjecture -- from the deities’ chubby, cheerful faces and other details as well as the principal Buddha’s imposing figure -- that it was carved between the late 6th and early 7th centuries. As suggested by its location in the area between Taean Peninsula and Buyeo, which had been a key strategic area linking Baekje southwest of the Korean Peninsula with the eastern coast of China, the triad is considered tangible evidence of the active cultural exchange between the two East Asian regions during the period when it was carved."

        "context": "This 15.5-centimeter tall Buddha triad was excavated in Bongsan-ri of Goksan-gun, Hwanghae-do, in 1930 and is currently housed in Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul. Featuring Shakyamuni Buddha attended to by two bodhisattvas, it is known as the largest existing triad carved in the style wherein all three statuettes are carved on a single large mandorla. The two bodhisattvas on both ends of the mandorla are made considerably smaller than the principal Buddha they attend to, making it appear more impressive. Save for slight damages inflicted on the Shakyamuni’s chest and on the low corner of the mandorla, the triad is preserved comparatively well. The principal Buddha of the triad is characterized by a plump face wearing a benign smile, a fairly large topknot (usnisa), and the heavenly robe heavily draped down from both shoulders to cover the entire body with the hem flaring outward. His right arm is raised to show the palm outward, whereas the left arm is lowered, also showing the palm outward. The mandorla is designed to be attached to the principal Buddha through a peg projected from his back. The boat-shaped mandorla consists of two halos -- the circular one is around the head, and the almond-shaped one is around the body -- as well as decorations of lotus, vine, honeysuckle, and flame motifs and three miniature Buddha images carved in low relief. The bodhisattvas attending to the principal Buddha exhibit disproportionately large heads, slender, tubular bodies, and robes with X-shaped folds. The attendants appear to have been made with poorer skills than those that created the principal Buddha. Behind the mandorla is an inscription revealing that the triad was commissioned by five Buddhist devotees to pray for their teachers and parents. The sculptural style of the triad and the names of the devotees suggest that it is a work of Goguryeo (37BC-668). Historians conjecture that the name of the year, “Sinmyo,” as contained in the inscription is 571 when the kingdom was under the rule of King Pyeongwon (r. 559-590). The general form of the triad and the details imply that it inherited the style of the gilt-bronze Buddha statuette designated as National Treasure No. 119, although the triad is generally regarded as more refined and sophisticated than the latter."

The pagoda was smuggled into Japan when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule in the early 20th century but was returned in 1960 and had been kept since then in Gyeongbokgung Palace until it was moved to its current location. The pagoda consists of a three-tier base in a polygonal shape and a ten-story body whose lowest three stories feature a polygonal shape, with the remaining seven stories having a square shape in plain view. Both the base and the main body are lavishly decorated with elaborately carved Buddha and bodhisattva images and floral motifs. The body stone of each story above the fourth is equipped with a set of railings and is covered with a hip-and-gable roof. There is an inscription on the first-story body stone, revealing that the pagoda was set up in 1348 when Goryeo (918-1392) was under the rule of King Chungmok (r. 1344-1348). The pagoda has been regarded as a fine example of the foreign style of Goryeo pagodas built in the period as it is, in addition to its unique form, made of marble rather than granite as practically the only type of rock used for Korean stone pagodas until then. The pagoda boasts of a beautiful structure with fine proportion and balance as well as elaborately carved ornamentation and roofstones with carefully rendered details including eaves, preserving the distinctive architectural features of the wooden buildings constructed during the late Goryeo. The pagoda is known to have had an influence on the Ten-story Stone Pagoda at Wongaksa Temple Site, Seoul (National Treasure No. 2) built during the Joseon Period. The original form of the pagoda, which had been marred during the process of smuggling, was restored through a ten-year conservation work (1995-2005) performed by the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage."

The body stone of each story above the fourth is equipped with a set of railings and is covered with a hip-and-gable roof. There is an inscription on the first-story body stone, revealing that the pagoda was set up in 1348 when Goryeo (918-1392) was under the rule of King Chungmok (r. 1344-1348). The pagoda has been regarded as a fine example of the foreign style of Goryeo pagodas built in the period as it is, in addition to its unique form, made of marble rather than granite as practically the only type of rock used for Korean stone pagodas until then. The pagoda boasts of a beautiful structure with fine proportion and balance as well as elaborately carved ornamentation and roofstones with carefully rendered details including eaves, preserving the distinctive architectural features of the wooden buildings constructed during the late Goryeo. The pagoda is known to have had an influence on the Ten-story Stone Pagoda at Wongaksa Temple Site, Seoul (National Treasure No. 2) built during the Joseon Period. The original form of the pagoda, which had been marred during the process of smuggling, was restored through a ten-year conservation work (1995-2005) performed by the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage."

The main item, the gold crown, has height of 44.4 centimeters and headband diameter of 19 centimeters, displaying the typical features of Silla crowns characterized by three tree-shaped ornaments erected from the front part of the base band and a pair of antler-shaped ornaments on the rear part. The base band and the erect ornaments are decorated with many dots and hung with jade drops and gold leaves. The crown also has a pair of gold strings draped down and decorated with gold foliage clusters arranged at regular intervals and a jade drop at each end. The crown was discovered along with an inner cap made of several pieces of thin gold plates decorated with several different geometrical patterns and an ornament shaped like a pair of open wings. Art historians believe that the decoration of the crown with the wing motif is connected with Shamanism, which was widespread during the three early Korean kingdoms (57BC-668). With its fine form and excellent workmanship, the crown is generally regarded as the greatest among all the Silla crowns discovered so far."

Each earring consists of thick, hollow ring at the top, interlocking, thinner ring, and double-tier clusters of tiny leaves plus a large, heart-shaped pendant at the lowest part. The large hollow rings have the surface ornately decorated with three or four-leaf designs contained in hexagonal shapes of tortoise shell made using the filigree and granulation techniques. The hanging ornaments of the lower section are further embellished by tiny gold granules. Most of the gold earrings of Silla discovered so far are decorated by the filigree and granulation techniques introduced from the Southwest Asian region. In particular, this pair of earrings is highly regarded for the lavish filigree and granulation ornamentation covering the surface of all parts."

Noteworthy is the fact that, in connection with its production site, shards of the same type of celadon ware have been discovered at Sadang-ri Kiln Nos. 7 and 8 in Gangjin, Jeollanam-do, although similar works have been excavated at some Goryeo tombs as well as some Cizhou Ware sites and Jingdezhen kilns in China. Produced in the early 12th century when Goryeo reached the zenith in its celadon art, it is widely regarded as the most beautiful melon-shaped celadon vessel discovered so far with its graceful, charming body nicely coated with attractive jade green glaze."

The surface is evenly and thinly coated with translucent celadon glaze that emits a delightful grayish-green luster. Experts believe -- from the quality of glazing and the shape of the jar -- that it was made in the 12th century when Goryeo had its heyday in celadon art. The celadon jar is particularly highly regarded for the masterful use of the “area-inlay” technique."

The pagodas are currently located in the National Museum of Korea in Seoul. Each pagoda exhibits the typical style of Silla stone pagodas consisting of a double-tier base and a three-story body. Each of the base’s four sides has two corner and two middle columns carved in low relief; the body and the roof of each story are made by carving a single stone block. Each of the three bodies has two corner columns also carved in low relief, and each roofstone has five-step cornices under the eaves. The discovered record engraved on the base of the eastern pagoda revealed that the pagodas were set up in 758 under the commission of Dharma Master Eonjeok and his two sisters. Remarkably, the inscription was written using an archaic Korean writing system called Idu wherein Chinese characters were borrowed to mark the sounds of the Korean verbal language. Both pagodas are in comparatively good condition except for the finials, which are now missing. Their size may not be considerable, but the outstanding structural balance and proportion and the well-preserved details showing the typical style of Silla pagodas make them a valuable part of the Korean Buddhist heritage."

It was not until many years later when a more extensive survey was conducted on the temple site that historians discovered the pagoda’s base along with the temple’s correct name, which is Namgyewon. The newly excavated double-tier base was moved to the location of its main structure at the palace precincts; finally, both were moved to and restored at the current location in the National Museum of Korea. The pagoda’s overall structure -- a double-tier base supporting the main body of seven stories -- is very similar to the typical style of Silla (57 BC – 935) pagodas; a closer look at its details reveals notable differences, however. First, the lower base of this pagoda is conspicuously taller than ordinary Silla pagodas, whereas the upper base is slightly lower. The body and roof of each story are made by carving a single stone block, and each body has a pair of corner columns carved in low relief. Each roof is comparatively thick, with corners turned up rather dramatically -- showing the influence of the Goryeo pagodas -- and three-step cornices under the eaves. The finial is heavily damaged, leaving only part of a “dew basin” (Noban) and an “overturned bowl” (Bokbal) carved with a single stone block. An imposing ambience created by a lofty structure -- carved using the techniques refined by Silla artisans -- and some details showing the influence of Goryeo masonry suggest that the pagoda was originally built before the mid-Goryeo period (918-1392). The 1915 restoration work led to the discovery of seven scrolls -- on which the Transcription of Saddharmapundarika Sutra (The Lotus Sutra) in Silver on Indigo Paper -- which were enshrined in the pagoda when it was renovated in 1283 when Goryeo was under the rule of King Chungnyeol (r. 1274-1308)."

It had been smuggled into Osaka, Japan during the early 1910s when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945) but was soon returned to be housed in the precincts of Gyeongbokgung Palace where it is today. Unlike ordinary stupas that came to have an octagonal shape after the Unified Silla era (676-935), this one is basically square in plain view. The foundation stone has four decorative carvings shaped like a dragon’s clawed foot tugging the ground on all four corners, creating a great sense of stability. Above the foundation is a base of seven tiers with different heights and widths whose top tier is decorated with elaborately carved draperies over all four sides. The main body is in turn carved with a pair of doors on the front and back to indicate that it contains a chamber enshrining the relics of the dead monk; the roofstone is gently turned up on all four corners, with all its eaves elaborately carved with Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and phoenixes. The finial is also in good condition. Meanwhile, a stone stele set up to mark the construction of the stupa is still standing on its original location at the Beopcheonsa Temple site. The stele contains an inscription stating that it was set up in 1805; thus suggesting that the stupa was built sometime between 1070, the year when the preceptor died, and 1085 when the stele was set up. The stupa is covered by decorative carvings of various subjects arranged in a seemingly unrestrained manner, but none of the details confuses the viewers thanks to the basic square structure and masterfully executed carvings. While some argue that the stupa has excessive decorations and consequently tends to reduce the solemnity it should maintain as a reliquary monument, it is generally regarded as one of the finest of its kind produced during the Goryeo period (918-1392)."

        "context": "This funerary stupa honoring eminent Goryeo monk and State Preceptor Jigwang (pen-name: Haerin, 984-1067) was originally located in Beopcheonsa, a Buddhist temple once located around today’s Wonju. It had been smuggled into Osaka, Japan during the early 1910s when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945) but was soon returned to be housed in the precincts of Gyeongbokgung Palace where it is today. Unlike ordinary stupas that came to have an octagonal shape after the Unified Silla era (676-935), this one is basically square in plain view. The foundation stone has four decorative carvings shaped like a dragon’s clawed foot tugging the ground on all four corners, creating a great sense of stability. Above the foundation is a base of seven tiers with different heights and widths whose top tier is decorated with elaborately carved draperies over all four sides. The main body is in turn carved with a pair of doors on the front and back to indicate that it contains a chamber enshrining the relics of the dead monk; the roofstone is gently turned up on all four corners, with all its eaves elaborately carved with Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and phoenixes. The finial is also in good condition. Meanwhile, a stone stele set up to mark the construction of the stupa is still standing on its original location at the Beopcheonsa Temple site. The stele contains an inscription stating that it was set up in 1805; thus suggesting that the stupa was built sometime between 1070, the year when the preceptor died, and 1085 when the stele was set up. The stupa is covered by decorative carvings of various subjects arranged in a seemingly unrestrained manner, but none of the details confuses the viewers thanks to the basic square structure and masterfully executed carvings. While some argue that the stupa has excessive decorations and consequently tends to reduce the solemnity it should maintain as a reliquary monument, it is generally regarded as one of the finest of its kind produced during the Goryeo period (918-1392)."

        "context": "This reliquary monument, set up to honor eminent Goryeo monk and State Preceptor Hongbeop, had originally been located at a Buddhist temple called Jeongtosa in Jungwon-gun (today’s Chungju), Chungcheongbuk-do but was moved to Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1915 and, finally, to its current location in the National Museum of Korea in Seoul. Hongbeop was an eminent spiritual leader for the Korean Buddhists in the 10th century, introducing them to Seon (or Zen) Buddhism that he had studied in Tang. He was given the honorable title “State Preceptor” (Guksa) after “Great Seon Master” (Seonsa) when Goryeo was under the reign of King Seongjong (981-997). The stupa features a foundation consisting of a square slab supporting an octagonal base and a three-tier pedestal whose lower pedestal is shaped like a down-turned lotus blossom; the octagonal middle pedestal is elaborately carved with dragons flying between clouds, and the upper pedestal is shaped like an upturned lotus blossom. On the pedestal is a spherical stone carved with ropes tying the stone sphere crisscross with floral motifs placed on the spots where the ropes intersect. The roofstone is comparatively simple, with no significant ornamentation except the “corner flowers,” most of which are now missing. Under the roofstone are heavenly maids carved in relief. As a work built in 1017 when Goryeo was under the rule of King Hyeonjong (r. 1010-1031), the stupa had introduced some new elements even as it also maintained the style of Silla stupas characterized by an octagonal structure. With fine balance and harmony between new and old techniques and elements and use of a spherical stone for its main feature, the monument is widely considered one of the most valuable stupas erected during the Goryeo period."

He had Chejing (804-880) as his head pupil and helped him lay a firm foundation for the development of Seon Buddhism. The stupa is generally presumed to have originally been at the Heungbeopsa Temple site in Gangwon-do. It was moved to Seoul where it was transferred to several different locations, including Tapgol Park and Gyeongbokgung Palace in downtown Seoul, until finding the current location in the National Museum of Korea. The remaining structure of the stupa is consisted of three parts, a three-tier base, octagonal main body, and roofstone which is also octagonal. The base is formed by combining three stones decorated with elegant carvings where the lower stone displays lions carved in relief, the middle stone incense burners carved in “elephant eyes”, and the upper stone, which is subdivided into two tiers, two bands of lotus petals for the lower tier and another set of “elephant eyes” containing various decorative carvings. The main body enshrining the priest’s relics (sarira) has eight faces each to contain either a door or one of the Four Guardian Kings, all elaborately carved in low relief. The roofstone is equally elaborately carved to present the tiled roof of the wooden buildings of the period complete with detailed furrows and ridges as well as the decorative roof-end tiles and rafters under the eaves. The finial is now missing. An inscription engraved on a gilt-bronze plate discovered during a rebuilding work revealed that the stupa was built in 844 when Unified Silla was under the rule of King Munseong (r. 839-857). The monument is highly regarded not just because it is known as the oldest remaining sarira stupa in Korea but also its elegant structure elaborately carved by masterful skills, setting a fine example for other stupas to follow."

He had Chejing (804-880) as his head pupil and helped him lay a firm foundation for the development of Seon Buddhism. The stupa is generally presumed to have originally been at the Heungbeopsa Temple site in Gangwon-do. It was moved to Seoul where it was transferred to several different locations, including Tapgol Park and Gyeongbokgung Palace in downtown Seoul, until finding the current location in the National Museum of Korea. The remaining structure of the stupa is consisted of three parts, a three-tier base, octagonal main body, and roofstone which is also octagonal. The base is formed by combining three stones decorated with elegant carvings where the lower stone displays lions carved in relief, the middle stone incense burners carved in “elephant eyes”, and the upper stone, which is subdivided into two tiers, two bands of lotus petals for the lower tier and another set of “elephant eyes” containing various decorative carvings. The main body enshrining the priest’s relics (sarira) has eight faces each to contain either a door or one of the Four Guardian Kings, all elaborately carved in low relief. The roofstone is equally elaborately carved to present the tiled roof of the wooden buildings of the period complete with detailed furrows and ridges as well as the decorative roof-end tiles and rafters under the eaves. The finial is now missing. An inscription engraved on a gilt-bronze plate discovered during a rebuilding work revealed that the stupa was built in 844 when Unified Silla was under the rule of King Munseong (r. 839-857). The monument is highly regarded not just because it is known as the oldest remaining sarira stupa in Korea but also its elegant structure elaborately carved by masterful skills, setting a fine example for other stupas to follow."

The pagoda exhibits the typical appearance of the Korean three-story stone pagodas with the double-tier base on which a three-story structure is erected.

Each tier of the base has four corner columns, two (lower tier) and one (upper tier) central columns, all carved in relief.

        "context": "This Buddhist monumental stele discovered at Biamsa Temple in Yeongi-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, features a stone structure in the shape of a rectangular cuboid elaborately carved with Buddhist images and inscriptions on all of its four sides. The front face has a carved rectangular border containing an Amitabha Triad where the principal Buddha seated on a square pedestal put on a lotus seat features an oval face and robust build in a stable, comfortable sitting posture. The hands, displaying a gesture symbolizing Buddha giving a sermon, are comparatively large, showing an influence from the tradition of the Three Kingdoms Period (57 BCE – 668). The robe covers both shoulders and is draped far down to cover almost the entire pedestal while the mandorla the head consists of three concentric circles and lotus design contained in them. There are on both sides under the pedestal two lions. The two attending bodhisattvas flanking the Buddha are standing on lotus pedestals which are laid upon the back of the lions. Their faces are heavily damaged but have mandorlas decorated with lotus designs. There are faces of arhats between the bodhisattvas’ shoulders and the principal Buddha, and beside the bodisattvas two pairs of Vajrapani, divine guardians of Buddha and his law. There are behind the Buddha and his attendants two layers of aureoles embellished with flame design and the inner aureole contains five miniature Buddhist images. The area above the outer aureole is lowered further by carving to contain the images of the celestial maids called apsara. Each of the monument’s two sides is carved with a dragon head at the lower part and above the animal four musicians playing their instruments each on a lotus pedestal. The rear face is divided into four tiers each with five miniature Buddhas in seated position and between each two miniature images names and titles of those who were involved in the project of erecting this monument. The monument is often connected with the Monumental Stele of Buddha Triad and a Thousand Buddhas with Inscription of “Gyeyu Year” (National Treasure No. 108) in that both are lavishly decorated with elaborate carvings creating solemn beauty and maintain rare ancient artistic elements. Experts believe that the monument was set up in 673 after Silla won a series of wars which led to the unification of the three early Korean kingdoms."

In the Joseon Period (1392-1910), the royal court had a tradition of sending court painters to the ceramic kilns operated under its support to decorate the ceramic vessels produced here with their paintings. Most of the decorations were painted in blue pigment, but there were other pigments, too, iron oxide which made attractive black pigment and copper oxide making red in particular. The grape design decorating the jar adds additional dignity to the pottery and, combined with its size and shape, makes it one of the finest examples of the white porcelain jars produced during the mid-Joseon period. Artistic merits of the jar include the mouth featuring a comfortable size and height and the voluminous, imposing shoulder. The aesthetic beauty of the jar is perfected with the grape design painted in iron oxide on the upper body thanks to the fruit with vines depicted in an immaculate, realistic manner and the masterful use of painting techniques, including the shading of a single color. The jar is a tangible evidence to show the development of the Korean ceramic art in the 18th century where painting became a key factor for the production of great white porcelain works."

The symbolic hand gesture, where the right hand is placed on the right knee with fingers downward, shows that he is interested in expelling evil. The two bodhisattvas standing on both sides of the Buddha display the same appearance in which each wears a crown carved with a miniature Buddha at the front center and holds a kundika, ritual water sprinkler, in one hand. They are also marked by wearing the beaded neck ornament, armlet, and robe draped downward, creating long U-shaped folds over the waist and knees. The comparatively slender and proportionate body with clearly defined neck, waist and legs shows an influence from the style developed in Tang (618-907), the Chinese dynasty of the same period. The triad is regarded historically significant in that it provides a fine example to show the transition of early Korean Buddhist sculpture from the Three Kingdoms to the following Unified Silla Periods and that it is enshrined at one of the first natural caves which was turned into a full-fledged temple in Korea."

The pagodas show that Gameunsa is one of the first Silla temples that adopted a new architectural system established directly after the unification of the three ancient Korean kingdoms in the 7th century wherein a temple had two pagodas in its precincts but had only one under the old system. Gameunsa was established in this part of the southeastern coastal area by King Munmu (r. 661-681) who, having completed the unification of the three Korean kingdoms, wanted to strengthen the dignity of the kingdom -- and repel the Japanese pirates who disturbed its eastern coastal region so often -- by invoking magical intervention from Buddha. The king died before the completion of the temple, which was materialized in 682 when Silla was under the reign of his son, King Sinmun (r. 681-692). The Silla rulers’ yearning for the protection of their kingdom from foreign enemies is reflected on the twin pagodas’ imposing figures. One of the characteristic features of these pagodas is that, unlike most other stone pagodas made in the same period wherein each story is made of a single block of stone, each story is built by fitting a multiple number of stone blocks together. A major repair work done in 1960 led to the discovery of a gilt-bronze sarira reliquary (Treasure No. 366-1) and its matching gilt-bronze outer case (Treasure No. 366-2) on the West Three-story Stone Pagoda. These are the largest stone pagodas to have survived in Gyeongju today and are widely admired as majestic figures soaring high on a raised land against the East Sea."

Gameunsa was established in this part of the southeastern coastal area by King Munmu (r. 661-681) who, having completed the unification of the three Korean kingdoms, wanted to strengthen the dignity of the kingdom -- and repel the Japanese pirates who disturbed its eastern coastal region so often -- by invoking magical intervention from Buddha. The king died before the completion of the temple, which was materialized in 682 when Silla was under the reign of his son, King Sinmun (r. 681-692). The Silla rulers’ yearning for the protection of their kingdom from foreign enemies is reflected on the twin pagodas’ imposing figures. One of the characteristic features of these pagodas is that, unlike most other stone pagodas made in the same period wherein each story is made of a single block of stone, each story is built by fitting a multiple number of stone blocks together. A major repair work done in 1960 led to the discovery of a gilt-bronze sarira reliquary (Treasure No. 366-1) and its matching gilt-bronze outer case (Treasure No. 366-2) on the West Three-story Stone Pagoda. These are the largest stone pagodas to have survived in Gyeongju today and are widely admired as majestic figures soaring high on a raised land against the East Sea."

The bowl is characterized by narrow foot, gently rounded sides, and widely everted large mouth. At the center of the inner bottom is a large circular flower motif rendered with the “reverse-inlaying” technique by which the central motif is highlighted by its background inlaid in white slip. The entire inner surface except the center and the edge is lavishly decorated with scroll motifs, also rendered by the same technique. Meanwhile, the outer surface features a band of foliage just below the mouth rim as well as chrysanthemum sprays on five points of the middle body, including flowers inlaid with white slip and stems and leaves with black. In addition to the contrast and balance between the decorative motifs and colors and inlaying techniques, the bowl is widely praised for the attractively translucent celadon glaze evenly coating the surface. It is also considered an important source of knowledge, containing ample information on the development of the inlaying technique by Goryeo potters during the mid-12th century."

The statue has lost its original pedestal and mandorla (Buddhist halo of light) but has a clear record of its background, i.e., it was commissioned by a local government official named Kim Su-jong who served the administration of Muju and Jangsa (today’s Gwangju and Jangheung). The Buddha features an oval, plump face with high-ridged, sharp nose and firmly sealed mouth as well as conch-shaped curls covering the head, which, together, help create a dignified look. Some, however, have the general impression that it is a somewhat conventional, rather than original, work. Comparing the Buddha statues of Unified Silla in the 8th century, this iron statue lacks dynamism and intensity in its details. The robe is draped from both shoulders to create several symbolic U-folds in the front and more over the arms and knees, but their rendition lacks resilience. Art historians agree that the statue provides a fine example of an artistic tendency of Silla in the 9th century when its Buddhist statues began to lose their early vitality and started to be stylized. The Buddha’s symbolic hand gesture -- the right hand holding the left index finger -- suggests that he is Vairocana, the Buddha of All Pervading Light. The statue is highly regarded in the history of Korean Buddhist art not just because it provides important information on the genealogy of Vairocana Buddha images in Korea with its date of production clearly known; it is also the earliest existing item of iron cast Buddhist statues that enjoyed great popularity in Korea during the period between the late Unified Silla and early Goryeo."

The statues of Buddha assuming a pensive posture had been found only in the archaeological sites of Baekje and Silla, suggesting that statues of this kind had been made only in the two ancient Korean kingdoms. The discovery of this statuette in 1944, however, revealed that Goguryeo, the third earliest Korean kingdom, had also worshipped bodhisattvas assuming a meditation pose. The bodhisattva statue features the head in a tri-peak headgear gently bent forward, square face with half-closed eyes and smiling mouth, naked upper body, slender waist, and skirt-like, lower garment draped down to cover the entire lower body and the pedestal, creating numerous folds as it hangs down. He has his left foot pendent on a small lotus pedestal and the right crossing the left knee. He holds the right ankle with his left hand but has lost the right forearm, although the fingers of his right hand are clearly touching the right cheek. The head is disproportionately large compared to the slender body; other details including the excavation site show that it is a work of Goguryeo (37BC-668) in the late 6th century."

It was found in Uiryeong, Gyeongsangnam-do which used to be a territory of the Silla Dynasty. The inscriptions on the rear of the mandorla (Buddhist halo of light) of the Buddha image state that the image is the 29th of the 1,000 Buddha images made by monks at Dongsa Temple in Pyeongyang. The Buddha image displays a small turban shell-shaped tuft of hair stuck to the head, which is rarely found among those dating back to the Three Kingdom Period (circa 57BC-668AD), along with usnisa (a protuberance symbolizing supreme wisdom). Its small-sized face wears a smile and looks lean. It holds the right hand up with the palm facing the front. The fingers of the left hand, which is placed near the waist, point downward with the palm facing the front. The bent middle and ring fingers of the left hand are common in Buddha images dating back to the Three Kingdom Period. The very thick robe conceals the contours of the body. The overall body and the shape of the shoulder give the impression of toughness. The lower ends of the robe, which look like bird feathers, extend outward powerfully. Their sharp and powerful appearance shows the influence of the pattern of Northern Wei of China. The mandorla behind the Buddha image has the pattern of whirling flame in lines. The mandorla is partly damaged, but it is a rare Buddha image dating back to the Three Kingdom Period and whose gold plating remains in good condition. Researchers suppose that it is a piece made toward the end of the 6th Century based on the Chinese characters on the rear side of the mandorla, along with the powerful feeling exuded by it."

It was found in Uiryeong, Gyeongsangnam-do which used to be a territory of the Silla Dynasty. The inscriptions on the rear of the mandorla (Buddhist halo of light) of the Buddha image state that the image is the 29th of the 1,000 Buddha images made by monks at Dongsa Temple in Pyeongyang. The Buddha image displays a small turban shell-shaped tuft of hair stuck to the head, which is rarely found among those dating back to the Three Kingdom Period (circa 57BC-668AD), along with usnisa (a protuberance symbolizing supreme wisdom). Its small-sized face wears a smile and looks lean. It holds the right hand up with the palm facing the front. The fingers of the left hand, which is placed near the waist, point downward with the palm facing the front. The bent middle and ring fingers of the left hand are common in Buddha images dating back to the Three Kingdom Period. The very thick robe conceals the contours of the body. The overall body and the shape of the shoulder give the impression of toughness. The lower ends of the robe, which look like bird feathers, extend outward powerfully. Their sharp and powerful appearance shows the influence of the pattern of Northern Wei of China. The mandorla behind the Buddha image has the pattern of whirling flame in lines. The mandorla is partly damaged, but it is a rare Buddha image dating back to the Three Kingdom Period and whose gold plating remains in good condition. Researchers suppose that it is a piece made toward the end of the 6th Century based on the Chinese characters on the rear side of the mandorla, along with the powerful feeling exuded by it."

The three-story body is placed on the two-tiered platform. The bottom platform is inscribed with Heavenly Figures in light and thin clothes. The top platform contains an inscription of the eight supernatural guardians of the Buddha Dharma holding weapons while seated on clouds. Each story of the pagoda body and its roof are made of stone. The first story of the body is inscribed with diverse Buddha images. Each roofstone has the four corners of its eaves raised slightly and a five-tiered bottom. The stupa finial is gone.

It is in relatively good condition, except for the trace of reattaching the head torn off from the body and the white hair on the forehead, which is gone. The statue wears a very tall, cylinder-shaped crown, with usnisa (a protuberance symbolizing supreme wisdom) placed atop the crown. The square-shaped face wears a tender smile and has half-closed eyes. The neck shows three thick lines. A three-lined necklace hangs down to the chest. The robe is inscribed with wrinkles that look soft and natural. The right hand holds a lotus branch up to the chest. The left hand is placed on the thigh. The forefingers of both hands are fully extended outward. As for the position of the feet, the right foot is placed behind the left one. These foot positions are the opposite of its twin (Treasure No.81) found from the same temple. This statue, made of white marble, is distinguished from the other stone statues found in Korea, which are mostly made of granite stone. The texture of the material used, along with the sculpture technique, gives a graceful, warm impression. Overall, the body looks plump and exhibits mature and exquisite sculpture technique. The cylinder-shaped crown, the plump face, and the gentle smile are features shared by those of the Stone Seated Bodhisattva at Sinboksa Temple Site, Gangneung and Stone Seated Bodhisattva of Woljeongsa Temple, Pyeongchang (Treasure Nos. 84 and 139, respectively).

It has a plump face wearing a gentle smile, including narrow shoulders as well as a protruding belly. A double layer of robe covering the belly and the lap hangs like the letter “U.” The legs are covered by the thick robe. Robe wrinkles are expressed simply with a few lines. The right hand holds a kundika bottle.

The shape of a Buddha inscribed on the pyramid-shaped figures attached to the crown and the kundika bottle held on the right hand show that it is an Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva image.

It recorded the status of the country during the Imjin Waeran (Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592), which started with the Japanese invasion of Korea. As a disciple of Yi Hwang (pen-name: Toegye), Yu Seong-ryong studied with Kim Seong-il and passed a state exam for recruiting high-ranking officials in 1566 (21st year of the reign of King Myeongjong). He steadily climbed the bureaucratic ladder and served as Prime Minister. He foresaw the Japanese invasion in the late 16th Century and asked the king to promote General Gwon Yul and Admiral Yi Sun-sin to important positions to make preparations to defend the country. He also recommended the production of weapons, including firearms, and the construction of defensive castle walls in major cities. He became renowned for his literary ability, calligraphy, and deep knowledge of neo-Confucianism. He was posthumously presented with the honorary title Munchung. His mortuary tablet was enshrined at Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy, a private school in Andong. It is not known when this book was written, but he wrote it while spending his later days in his hometown years after retiring from official positions. The book contains accurate information such as the country’s pre-war relationship with Japan, the dispatch of troops by China’s Ming Dynasty to rescue Korea, the Korean Navy’s supremacy in sea battles, etc. A transcribed copy of this book was published in 7 books in 16 volumes in 1647 (25th year of the reign of King Injo) by Gyeongsang-do Governor Jo Su-ik at the request of a grandson of the writer. Another copy was published in Yamatoya, Kyoto, Japan in 1695 (21st year of the reign of King Sukjong). Its preciousness was recognized by the Korean government, and an order not to let its copy be taken to Japan was issued in 1712.

It is a unique object with the triad, a mandorla, and a pedestal in one piece. The round-faced main Bodhisattva in the center wears a crown. It shows thin underwear worn diagonally. The two parts of the thick outer robe cross each other in the front, and then spread out at the bottom like bird feathers. The lower part of the robe extends down to the ankle. Robe wrinkles are portrayed in lines. The right hand is raised to the shoulder, with the palm facing outward. The fingers of the left hand are pointing downward, with the ring finger and the little finger bent inward. The two attendant Arhats stand with their hands clasped, wearing thick robes. The mandorla behind the triad is shaped like a boat with a conspicuous-looking edge, with three lines forming the head and body mandorla. The head mandorla is inscribed with lotus flower patterns. Exquisite flame patterns are shown outside the head and body mandorla. The pedestal on which the main Bodhisattva stands displays large-sized lotus flower patterns in double lines. The use of such style in the pedestal is similar to that of the Gilt-bronze Standing Sakyamuni Buddha Triad with Inscription of “Jeong Ji-won” (Treasure No. 196) and Gilt-bronze Pensive Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure No. 83) unearthed from Busosan Mountain in Buyeo. Thus, the image was presumed to date back to the Baekje Period, but it is more exquisitely portrayed than the former. The parts of the robe crossing each other like the letter “X,” the bottom of the robe spreading outward like bird feathers, the fingers of the left hand bent inward, etc., follow a typical style of Buddha images made during the Three-Kingdoms Period (circa 57BC-668AD). The two Arhats standing next to the main Bodhisattva represent the first practice ever displayed by ancient relics found on the Korean Peninsula. Thus, the piece is considered to be a unique and precious object."

It is composed of eight cylinders interlocked with each other, with the dragon head at the top. Scales are inscribed on the neck of the dragon head for realistic effect. The horns attached to the dragon head make it look more energetic. Thin, dark-brown lacquer was applied to the dragon head, and gold plating was then added. Today, most of the gold plating is gone. The piece made during the Goryeo Period (918-1392) shows how the flagpole had developed as a refined handicraft since the Silla Period (57BC-935AD). Since the head adornment is missing and most of the danggan relics still remain, this one is regarded as a precious material."

Usnisa (a protuberance symbolizing supreme wisdom) is shown. The face of the Buddha image is portrayed to be rather large, looking stern and energetic. The thin robe displays the curves of the body. Robe wrinkles are expressed in thin lines, with the robe extending down to the pedestal. Overall, the statue displays the robe wrinkles exquisitely, with the voluminous body indicating resilience. Compared to the imposing-looking body, the arms are thin. The fingers of the right hand point to the bottom, and those of the left hand are placed on the lap with the palm facing up. The head halo -- carved separately from the body halo -- contains inscriptions of lotus and scrolling vine patterns, with flame patterns adorning the edge. Overall, the Rock-carved Seated Buddha in Wolchulsan Mountain gives an impression of stability and magnanimity. A sense of truthfulness to life is felt from the exquisite technique. The disproportionate, rigid expression of the body (e.g., large face compared to the small body, too thin arms) leads researchers to believe that it was made between the late Unified Silla Period (676 - 935) and the early Goryeo Period (918-1394)."

Next to the right lap of the Buddha image, an 86cm-high image of a baby monk with both hands clasped was carved in the direction of the image. Usnisa (a protuberance symbolizing supreme wisdom) is shown. The face of the Buddha image is portrayed to be rather large, looking stern and energetic. The thin robe displays the curves of the body. Robe wrinkles are expressed in thin lines, with the robe extending down to the pedestal. Overall, the statue displays the robe wrinkles exquisitely, with the voluminous body indicating resilience. Compared to the imposing-looking body, the arms are thin. The fingers of the right hand point to the bottom, and those of the left hand are placed on the lap with the palm facing up. The head halo -- carved separately from the body halo -- contains inscriptions of lotus and scrolling vine patterns, with flame patterns adorning the edge. Overall, the Rock-carved Seated Buddha in Wolchulsan Mountain gives an impression of stability and magnanimity. A sense of truthfulness to life is felt from the exquisite technique. The disproportionate, rigid expression of the body (e.g., large face compared to the small body, too thin arms) leads researchers to believe that it was made between the late Unified Silla Period (676 - 935) and the early Goryeo Period (918-1394)."

Annals covering the period from the reigns of King Taejo to King Myeongjong are one of the four copies transcribed from the Jeonju Archive's edition from July in the 36th year of King Seonjo (1603) to March of the 39th year (1606). Then, newly compiled annals were continuously updated till the Cheoljong sillok (Annals of King Cheoljong) was published in the second year of King Gojong (1865). From the 39th year of King Seonjo (1606) to 1910, they continued to be preserved at the Taebaeksan Mountain archive. Then they were moved to Gyeongseong Imperial University (predecessor of the present Seoul National University) in 1930 under the Japanese Imperial Regime; after the Liberation, they were housed at Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies of Seoul National University. Presently, parts of the Annals of King Seongjong, Volumes 70, 71, 80, 132 and 133 are missing."

These journals are invaluable because they supplement Joseon Wangjo Sillok (Annals of the Joseon Dynasty) and offer even more interesting details to study the late Joseon Dynasty."

One is 30.7cm tall and 14cm wide, and the other is 29.2cm tall and 13.6cm wide. They were found from the head of the king’s coffin, which was excavated in 1971. A gold plate is cut into the shape of a vine. There are a couple of branches at the bottom with a few tiny holes on the upper and lower parts. The holes seem to have been used to hang the ornament on an object. A flower pattern is in the middle of the branches, which are parted to the left and right. The long branches make the ornament look like a flame. The two lower branches are hanging down, giving a variation to the design. There are 127 bead-shaped decorations tied with golden string all over the front side of the ornament. This tomb was built for King Muryeong, the 25th king of the Baekje Dynasty who reigned from 501 to 522, and his queen. It’s one of the most well-known royal tombs because it’s one of the rare tombs that were built with bricks, and also a great amount of burial goods - 2906 pieces of remains ranging over 108 categories - were excavated from it. They have been regarded as important sources for studying Baekje, particularly the culture and customs of the ancient kingdom.

These earrings were for the queen. They have many small ornaments connected to a thick ring. One pair is elaborately designed, with each earring having two long and small ornamental strips. The other pair is simply designed, with each earring having only one strip. The long strip on the first pair has a chain made of a twisted gold strip with many round ornaments connected to it. Eight round ornaments are connected with a small ring to the end of the long strip, and a bullet-shaped ornament is attached to the bottom ends. The bullet-shaped ornament was also found from the remains of the Goguryeo Kingdom but those of Baekje are more rare and unique in shape. The short strip is almost identical in shape, but it doesn't have the bullet-shaped ornament. It has a leaf-shaped ornament and a round light green jade attached to it. This tomb was built for King Muryeong, the 25th king of the Baekje Dynasty who reigned from 501 to 522, and also his queen. It’s one of the most well-known royal tombs because it’s one of the rare tombs that were built with bricks, and also a great amount of burial goods - 2906 pieces of remains ranging over 108 categories - were excavated from it. They have been regarded as important sources for studying Baekje, particularly the culture and customs of the ancient kingdom.

These earrings were for the queen. They have many small ornaments connected to a thick ring. One pair is elaborately designed, with each earring having two long and small ornamental strips. The other pair is simply designed, with each earring having only one strip. The long strip on the first pair has a chain made of a twisted gold strip with many round ornaments connected to it. Eight round ornaments are connected with a small ring to the end of the long strip, and a bullet-shaped ornament is attached to the bottom ends. The bullet-shaped ornament was also found from the remains of the Goguryeo Kingdom but those of Baekje are more rare and unique in shape. The short strip is almost identical in shape, but it doesn't have the bullet-shaped ornament. It has a leaf-shaped ornament and a round light green jade attached to it. This tomb was built for King Muryeong, the 25th king of the Baekje Dynasty who reigned from 501 to 522, and also his queen. It’s one of the most well-known royal tombs because it’s one of the rare tombs that were built with bricks, and also a great amount of burial goods - 2906 pieces of remains ranging over 108 categories - were excavated from it. They have been regarded as important sources for studying Baekje, particularly the culture and customs of the ancient kingdom. Among them, jiseok, a slab of stone inscribed with the deceased's date of birth and death together with his achievements, reveals the exact owner of the tomb and the exact date of construction. The Royal Tomb of King Muryeong is the first among all the tombs from the Three Kingdoms Period that records the name of the buried king and the exact date of construction."

Though the dragons are not very elaborate, they look powerful enough to go well with the thick bracelets. The phrase 'Gyeongjanyeon Irwol Dari Jak Daebuingu Ibaesejui' is carved on the inner surface of one of the two bracelets. Here, the term ‘Gyeongjanyeon’ means 520, the year the manufacture. That means these bracelets were made in 520, 6 years before the death of the Queen Consort. ‘Dari’ is the name of the craftsman who made these bracelets. ‘Daebuin’ most likely refers the Queen Consort and ‘Ibaeksejui’ refers to the weight of the bracelets. These are the only ornaments with a phrase engraved on them, telling the exact production dates and their creator.

Turtleback patterns are inside of the golden frames. There are images of flying angels, a flying Chinese phoenix with its wings spread, a swimming dragon, lotus blossoms and vine patterns painted with white, red, black and golden color powder inside the turtleback patterns.

This ewer with a height of 28cm and bottom width of 11.6cm has a hole in the hat of the Taoist priest for pouring water into the ewer, and another one on the front side of a peach for pouring out water. A handle is attached to the back of the Taoist priest with a small ring at the top of the handle. The hat is decorated with bird shaped ornaments. There are many decorative white dots on the hat, neckband, breast-tie and peaches. Light green celadon glaze is thickly coated on the body of the ewer. The ewer was discovered at an orchard on the outskirts of Daegu in 1971 and later designated as one of the National Treasures of Korea. It is an excellent celadon ewer of the early 13th century, with the exact known excavation site."

The flask-shaped bottle, 2.17cm in height and 7.7cm in base diameter, has a round and flat body. The mouth widens slightly at the top and the foot is slim and long, thus giving the bottle a peculiar figure. The bottle has a dexterous black inlay of peony and vine and has a thin coat of white porcelain revealing fine net-like cracks. The epitaph slab is inscribed with the record of the life of a deceased person and placed in his/her tomb. This epitaph slab, 20.4 by 36.6cm, has lotus leaves depicted in natural lines above and a lotus flower engraved between two oblique lines below. The inscription is in seven lines: Written in the center in bold strokes is \"Tomb of Yeongin Jeong of Jinyang-gun\". The date of death and other items such as her family are written on both sides. The form is almost identical to that of the Celadon Epitaph Slab with Inlaid Design (1435 during the reign of Queen Seondeok) in the possession of the Ewha Womans University Museum.

        "context": "Yeongin (a title conferred on the wife of an official of the fourth court rank) Jeong of Jinyang-gun is the mother of Kim Yun, who was a prefectural governor under the reign of King Sejo. Her tomb yielded ten pieces of Joseon white porcelain including cups, plates, bowls, a flask-shaped bottle and an epitaph slab. The flask-shaped bottle, 2.17cm in height and 7.7cm in base diameter, has a round and flat body. The mouth widens slightly at the top and the foot is slim and long, thus giving the bottle a peculiar figure. The bottle has a dexterous black inlay of peony and vine and has a thin coat of white porcelain revealing fine net-like cracks. The epitaph slab is inscribed with the record of the life of a deceased person and placed in his/her tomb. This epitaph slab, 20.4 by 36.6cm, has lotus leaves depicted in natural lines above and a lotus flower engraved between two oblique lines below. The inscription is in seven lines: Written in the center in bold strokes is \"Tomb of Yeongin Jeong of Jinyang-gun\". The date of death and other items such as her family are written on both sides. The form is almost identical to that of the Celadon Epitaph Slab with Inlaid Design (1435 during the reign of Queen Seondeok) in the possession of the Ewha Womans University Museum. The black inlay of characters and patterns is coated with white porcelain showing fine net-like cracks now. Judging from the clay, these are thought to have inherited the tradition of Goryeo white porcelain. The peculiar figure of the flask-shaped bottle suggests they may have been manufactured at Eonyang or Gichang in the Gyeongsang-do Province. The cup and saucer are all-white porcelain. The handle is shaped like a toothed wheel, which is a very rare example among early Joseon white porcelain. It seems to have been made as a burial accessory."

The outer jar is decorated with lotus flowers, chrysanthemums, symbols of Buddha and thread-like raindrops. There are lotus flower patterns in the shape of a belt on the lower part of the larger, outer jar. On the cover of the inner jar is a hexagon pattern in the shape of a tortoise. These jars are regarded as buncheong (celadon) masterpieces, which were primarily produced in the mid-15th century. This type of jars was used particularly for storing an umbilical cord, an ancient tradition of Korea that was practiced in order to supplicate for the health and well-being of the new born.

As a famous literati painter himself, Kim Jeong-hui created his own style calligraphy called chusache. As his representative piece of artwork, this picture (69.2cm x 23cm) was drawn while he was living in exile in Jejudo Island. In the corner of the picture, there is a description in his own writing revealing that this is a gift in return for the valuable books sent by his follower Yi Sang-jeok who was staying in Beijing, China. The two ever-green trees in the picture symbolize their strong tie as a teacher and a student. This picture depicts one snow-covered cottage with the pine tree on the left and the cone pine tree on the right.

The Buddha is wearing a bead necklace, which comes down from the shoulders to the belly, forming an X shape. Wearing various accessories including an elaborate design by using different beads in the connecting joints, it’s worthy of note among other Bodhisattva statues of Silla. The right hand is holding a bead ornament, while the left hand seemed to have been holding a Buddhist ritual sprinkler and lotus branches, both of which are missing. A mandorla and pedestal are also missing, while the handle of mandorla is well-maintained. Below the feet hangs a pillar, shaped point for setting up the pedestal. As a whole, it is assumed that it was made in the early 7th century, judging from its grave and dignified look as well as splendid and elaborate ornaments, which are some of the main characteristics of the Buddha statues made in ancient China. As a unique and rare style of gilt-bronze Bodhisattva, it is of great value."

The Chinese letter is in the shape of quadplex with flower blossoms on the end. 3. There is much harmony between the bent jade and golden circle deck. 4. Another decorative element is the golden deck and the golden thread. The two dangling fixings in the form of a leaf is attached to the end of the crown. But when the crown was excavated, they were separated from the wide belt of the crown. Due to other remains that were discovered outside the coffin, this crown has been in controversy, particularly in regards to how it was worn and the proper etiquette regarding when it was worn at the time."

The bottle is 25cm in height and 9.5cm in diameter, and each cup is of different size: Cup I is 12.5cm in height, 10cm in diameter. Cup II is 8cm in height, 10.5cm in diameter. Cup III is 10.5cm height, 9.5cm in diameter. The bottle, made of thin glass, is in the shape of a long egg-like ellipse, soft green in color. Details of the bottle are as follows: 1. The top of the bottle is like a bird's muzzle for the convenience of pouring water. 2. Like Persian dishes, it has a unique curve: a delicate neck and horn-styled coaster. 3. There are 10 fine, blue lines on the neck and a little coarse string on the mouth. 4. Attached on the handle is the first letter of the Korean alphabet, ‘ㄱ’. The golden thread rolled on the grip seems to be proof of repairs due to damage before the burial. Glass cup I is light green in color and is broad on top and narrow on the bottom. Some characteristics of cup I are: 1. A decorative vacant tube-like form around the mouth and another blue, decorative line of glass just over it. 2. The engraving of blue wave patterns on the upper body and lattice below it is unique. Glass cup II is light green and has a broad mouth. Details of cup II are as follows: 1. Rather thick around the mouth and around it are small risings, 2. The appearance of a dent in the middle of the base. Glass cup III is also light green in color and the shape of mouth is broad and cubic. Features of cup III are as follows: 1. A decorative tube is around the mouth. 2. Light blue in color on the top and below. Although they were found deeply damaged at the time they were dug up, they have all, fortunately, been restored to their original form.

A summary painting colored in gold is found at the beginning of the book. The book also has what-seems-to-be-the cover, which is decorated with a painting of heavenly guards, Buddhist saints, flowers and plants.

This monument made of a natural rock was discovered in 1978 partially buried in the ground. The upper portion is wider and thicker than the lower portion. Much of the upper portion is destroyed. However, both sides remain relatively intact. About 440 Chinese characters are believed to have been inscribed on the monument, only two-thirds of which are legible. The printed style of writing with traces of the square style is of great importance for the study of calligraphy. The inscription refers to a resident of Jeokseong who helped Silla expand into the Goguryeo territory and states that whoever would be loyal to Silla would also be generously rewarded. It also contains King Jinheung's promulgation of state policies including legal and administrative systems, which well displays the property distribution and compulsory labor system of the period. Judging from a list of 10 high-ranking officials touched on in the preface of the inscription, and Samguk sagi (History of the Three Dynastys), the monument is believed to have been erected between 545 and 550 during the reign of King Jinheung of Silla. Although this is not a monument which commemorates border inspection trips by the king, it is considered the earlier form of such monuments and has great historical significance."

The printed style of writing with traces of the square style is of great importance for the study of calligraphy. The inscription refers to a resident of Jeokseong who helped Silla expand into the Goguryeo territory and states that whoever would be loyal to Silla would also be generously rewarded. It also contains King Jinheung's promulgation of state policies including legal and administrative systems, which well displays the property distribution and compulsory labor system of the period. Judging from a list of 10 high-ranking officials touched on in the preface of the inscription, and Samguk sagi (History of the Three Dynastys), the monument is believed to have been erected between 545 and 550 during the reign of King Jinheung of Silla. Although this is not a monument which commemorates border inspection trips by the king, it is considered the earlier form of such monuments and has great historical significance."

Although it was not clear whether a Bodhisattva was carved on the northern surface of the rock, because it was seriously worn away, this Bodhisattva in a combination with other two Bodhisattvas presented a triad.

The right hand is raised to the chest, while the left hand, giving a greater solemn impression, lied on the lap. As for the backside of the Buddha image, there is a mandorla divided into nimbus around the head, the body and a changed Buddha in many places. Lotus patterns are elaborately carved into the center of the nimbus round the head. It seems that it was made in the late seventh century, judging from its gentle image on the face and body. With the Rock-carved Buddha Triad and Seated Buddha (Treasure No. 221) in Gaheung-dong, Yeongju, this is one of the greatest works of art found in Yeongju and Bonghwa."

The painting has a similar composition as the copy kept at Haeinsa Temple, but the former much more exquisite than the latter. This seems to be the oldest piece of work among the ones known to date."

The monument was set up to commemorate the occupation of a number of fortresses along the Namhangang River by Goguryeo troops. It was discovered in 1979 in a village named Ipseok. The monument had already been severely eroded by time and local residents' negligence when discovered. It is in the form of a natural stone pillar, a smaller version of the monument to King Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo located in Manchuria, China. The inscription is engraved on four sides, but only the letters on the front and one side are legible for now. Based on the mention of King of Goryeo in the preface of the inscription, Goryeo here means Goguryeo, the inclusion of the names of official posts unique to Goguryeo, and the terms referring to Silla used by Goguryeo, this is undoubtedly a Goguryeo monument. Judging from what is legible, the monument is believed to date to around the late fifth century when King Jangsu of Goguryeo moved the capital to Pyeongyang and extended the Dynasty's territory southward to the basin of the Hangang River. With its rarity and valuable content illustrating the relations between Goguryeo, Silla and Baekje, this monument is of great importance for the study of Korean history."

It is famous for holding Buddha's ashes. The stupa is in the shape of a bell. Each face is 17cm and consists of three parts: the ceiling, body, and walls. The original gilding still remains intact on the surface today. The angles of the hexagon produce holes on each wall. The two faces of the body were carved by using lines and dots harmoniously into a Buddhist, the image of the universe called cheonbu, and Buddha's guardian carrying a drum called geumgangjeo. The rest of the faces, of the Four Guardian Kings, are engraved in lines only. The artistic value of these is the mysterious arrangement of damuncheon (a guardian whose name means being able to listen to the heavens) in which he appears to be lifting a tower. The eaves might have been used to attach decorations for metal rings remain on the ceiling.

        "context": "This stupa is called Bohyeobin Stupa (the Stupa of Treasure-casket Seal) because it enshrines Bohyeobin Dharani Sutra (the Sutra of Treasure-casket Seal Incantation). This kind of stupa dates back to the Chinese Wu and Yueh period. Quian Hongshu, the last king of Wu and Yueh, first built 84,000 miniature stupas made of gold, silver or iron and enshrined the sutra in all of them, imitating the anecdote of King Asoka of the Indian Mauryan Dynasty who is said to have divided Sakyamuni's true body sarira into 84,000 portions and enshrined them in as many pagodas. This stone stupa, the only extant one of its kind in Korea, is on display at the Dongguk University Museum. The stupa was found on the site of an old temple in Daepyeong-ri, Buk-myeon, Cheonan City. As there is no record left about the temple, even the name of the temple is unavailable. Judging from the remaining portion of stone terrace and foundation stones and fragments of roof tiles, the temple is believed to date to the Goryeo period. As much of the stupa has long disappeared, it was only partially restored with five remaining stone parts. Unlike typical Korean-style pagodas or stupas, the stupa has no clear distinction between the foundation and the main body. It looks as if two lidded caskets are piled up one upon another, with donkey ear-shaped ornament installed on the upper casket. A square base stone is installed on a hexahedron which is decorated with a design of Buddha's pedestal. On the top of the base is laid another hexahedron which deems to be the main body of the stupa. On all sides of the body-like portion are carved tales of Buddha's former life. There is a hole (7cm in diameter and 6cm in depth) in the center of the upper portion of the body. The hole is presumed to have enshrined the sutra. The donkey ear-like top portion has an inscription telling of Sakyamuni's life in two stages. This stupa which has a variety of sculptures on all sides seems to have been influenced by that of China. With its uniqueness and peculiar shape, this stupa is of great value for the study of Buddhist stonework."

The main idea of the book is that the way to become a Buddha is be open to everybody. Along with the Avatamsaka Sutra, it has made a great influence in establishing Korean Buddhist philosophy. It is the most widely circulated Buddhist scripture since the Period of Three Kingdoms. This book contains the seven volumes of the Lotus Sutra translated by Kumārajiva of the Late Chin of China. The scripture was carefully hand-copied by Ha Deokran in 1377 (the 3rd year of King U of Goryeo) with a prayer for longevity of his father and soul of his deceased mother. The contents were written in ink on white mulberry papers. Each volume is made in the form of a folding screen 10.9cm long and 31.8cm wide. On the cover of each volume is a magnificent picture of flowers painted in gold and silver. The title of each book is also written on it in gold. At the beginning of each book is a detailed painting of the summary of the content colored in gold. From a remark left at the end of the book by a Japanese we can tell that this book had been taken to Japan around 1443 (the 25th year of King Sejong of Joseon) and kept in the royal storage of Gwangdaewon since 1605 (the 38th year of King Seonjo). This book contains both the writings that tell the reason why this was produced and the painting that summarizes the content. It has been kept in a relatively good condition. In particular, having been recovered from Japan, it is considered as a valuable cultural asset."

The Amitabha is sending his beam of light down to the reborn soul, with Jijang Bodhisattva standing with a single bead in his right hand, while Bodhisattva Gwaneum is making a bow presenting lotus-pod-seat to the Amitabha. The matter of replacing the assistant Bodhisattva, the different postures they take, and their colorful appearance sparkling with gold make this picture quite a rare one of its kinds representing the late Goryeo Period."

Some of of its characteristics include: 1. Appearance: It narrows a little inwardly at the lip and the upper part of the body is convex though it becomes narrower and widens a bit in the lower half. 2. Patterns: On the lip, there are two horizontal lines, then alternating flowers and double rings just below it, then one horizontal line again. On the shoulder is a very brilliantly and ornamentally painted lotus. On the body, there are plums and bamboos in great detail; the former pictured with crossing branches and the latter with delicacy. 3. Skill: The outline was sketched first, and then painted carefully. This process is called gureukjinchaebeop, intending to create realism in pictures. According to experts, the patterns on the body, deftness, color, and shape, are influenced by the white jars with soft blue manufactured during the Ming Dynasty in China. This jar is regarded as being the first attempt at Cheonghwabaekja (a jar with blue-and-white color) produced at Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do (center of the Korean Peninsula) in the middle of the 15th century."

Sangwonsa Temple was closely related with the Manjusri Religion. The statue of the young monk in Sangwonsa Temple is worthy of note since it was the only young monk statue built for worshipping. With its head dropped, the body was well balanced. It had its hair tied up to both sides, while both full cheeks gave a naive impression.

        "context": "This stone slab with the carvings of a planisphere, a chart of constellations, was made in 1396 by 11 astronomers including Gwon Geun and Yu Bang-taek under orders by King Taejo, the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, to symbolize the mandate of heaven for his new dynasty. The stone chart is on display at the National Palace Museum of Korea. This planisphere consists of two sections. Much of its content was derived from an old chart made in Goguryeo. Constellations are engraved on the upper portion with brief explanation. The lower portion is inscribed with the name, the background of the production process, names of participants and the date of production. With the North Pole in the center, the chart displays the Zodiac and the celestial equator. The constellations contain all of 1,464 stars visible to ordinary sight. Twelve lines run across the heaven around the Zodiac and the stars are depicted in dots.

        "context": "The water clock was used for standard hours since the Three Kingdoms Period. Jagyeongnu, made in 1434 during the reign of King Sejong of Joseon, was the first water clock that was devised to strike the hour automatically with a bell, gong or drum. However, as it had not been properly preserved, King Jungjong had it remade in 1536, of which only some parts remain to the present. The bronze receptacle is 93.5cm in diameter and 70.0cm in height. The smaller ceramic vessel is 46.0cm in diameter and 40.5cm in height. Two pedestals for the latter still remain behind the Myeongjeongjeon Hall of Changgyeonggung Palace. The design of this water clock is as follows: The water poured into the upper largest vessel goes down via the smaller one into the long water tank. As the water level rises to the previously set position, a floating rod touches the lever device, which causes a bead at the other end to roll down to hit another bead. This bead, while rolling, triggers many devices to strike the gong, bell and drum or for a wooden puppet to lift up the time notice board. However, this no longer functions as only the vessel parts remain to this day. This water clock was made a little later than the one that had been made by the Ming Dynasty, China.

        "context": "The molds called yongbeom, geopujip or juhyeong in Korean, from the Bronze Age were used to cast bronze tools and weapons. Historically, it is known that ancient Europeans used molds made of stone and clay while ancient Indians and Egyptians developed a method using wax in casting their tools. In China, a variety of molding techniques were developed during the era of Longshan Culture, around 2000 BC. As seen by the relics found in Yeongam-gun of Jeollanam-do, ancient Koreans favored stone molds. The molds are said to have been excavated just after Korea became an independent country in 1945. Sadly, no details of the excavation are known. 1) Bronze Dagger Mold. Two of these molds were used to make a dagger. The shape of one side (as seen here) is 34.5cm in width, 7.4cm in length, and 4cm in height. The actual length of a knife able to be manufactured by this mold is 33cm. Because this mold has been heavily used, it has been burned black and parts of it have fallen in slightly. 2) Bronze Dagger and Spear Mold. One face of this mold was used for making sehyeongdonggeom (copper knife) and the other for producing donggwa (javelin). When the two faces are used together, they form a spear. The size of one side is 35.5cm in width, 8.8cm in length, and 4.1cm in height. For it was used heavily, all parts of the geom (knife) and gwa (javelin) mold are scorched black. 3) Bronze Axe, Hatchet and Chisel Mold. This is also supposed to have been employed by putting together opposing sides. This was manufactured for making three tools: one face was for dokki or dongbu (axe shaped in a form of a circle), and the other face made kkeul or chak (chisel) and jagwi or sodongbu (small sized axe). Metal rings were attached to the circular axe and the small sized axes and chisels were tools for work. 4) Bronze Axe and Hook Mold. This is a mold for making axes having a blade shaped in the form of a fan. It consists of two sides, one frame molding for hooks called jochim or naksibaneul and needles called baneul or chim. The frames of the hook and needles for this particular mold must not have been used at all for there are no burnt traces around the frames. In contrast, the frame for a copper axe has some burnt tracks around it. 5) Bronze Hatchet and Hook Mold. This is also supposed to have been used in making small knives. It consists of two faces, and the size of one face is 11.93cm in width, 7.05cm in length, and 2.17cm in height. The back of one of the faces also produced a pair of hooks and two isolated hooks. The back of the other face, had it been completed, would have made a mirror frame having fine comb patterns called danyusemungyeong. The failure to make mirrors having fine comb patterns has many experts believe that this mold must have been used in producing copper axes called dongbu. This particular hook frame does not show any visible scars from burning, indicating that it was not used. 6) Bronze Hatchet and Chisel Mold. The bronze hatchet and chisel mold also consists of two sides: one for producing a small axe called jagwi and the other for two chisels called kkeul. The hook matrix attaching a hook called jochim or naksibaneul and needles called baneul or chim.

The hook matrix attached to both sides of the frame was also used for making needles. 7) Bronze Dagger and Spear Mold. There is only one face. One one side of the face, the mold made copper spears called dongmo and the other side produced knives made of coffer and having many fine comb patterns. It is 20.2cm wide, 7.45cm long and 2.43cm high) Bronze Dagger, Spear and Needle Mold. This must have been used in manufacturing sehyeong donggeom yongbeom, coffer knives having soft comb patterns on one face and in making frames for producing needles, chimyongbeom, and copper spears, dongsa or cheongdongchang.

The shape of one side (as seen here) is 34.5cm in width, 7.4cm in length, and 4cm in height. The actual length of a knife able to be manufactured by this mold is 33cm. Because this mold has been heavily used, it has been burned black and parts of it have fallen in slightly. 2) Bronze Dagger and Spear Mold. One face of this mold was used for making sehyeongdonggeom (copper knife) and the other for producing donggwa (javelin). When the two faces are used together, they form a spear. The size of one side is 35.5cm in width, 8.8cm in length, and 4.1cm in height. For it was used heavily, all parts of the geom (knife) and gwa (javelin) mold are scorched black. 3) Bronze Axe, Hatchet and Chisel Mold. This is also supposed to have been employed by putting together opposing sides. This was manufactured for making three tools: one face was for dokki or dongbu (axe shaped in a form of a circle), and the other face made kkeul or chak (chisel) and jagwi or sodongbu (small sized axe). Metal rings were attached to the circular axe and the small sized axes and chisels were tools for work. 4) Bronze Axe and Hook Mold. This is a mold for making axes having a blade shaped in the form of a fan. It consists of two sides, one frame molding for hooks called jochim or naksibaneul and needles called baneul or chim. The frames of the hook and needles for this particular mold must not have been used at all for there are no burnt traces around the frames. In contrast, the frame for a copper axe has some burnt tracks around it. 5) Bronze Hatchet and Hook Mold. This is also supposed to have been used in making small knives. It consists of two faces, and the size of one face is 11.93cm in width, 7.05cm in length, and 2.17cm in height. The back of one of the faces also produced a pair of hooks and two isolated hooks. The back of the other face, had it been completed, would have made a mirror frame having fine comb patterns called danyusemungyeong. The failure to make mirrors having fine comb patterns has many experts believe that this mold must have been used in producing copper axes called dongbu. This particular hook frame does not show any visible scars from burning, indicating that it was not used. 6) Bronze Hatchet and Chisel Mold. The bronze hatchet and chisel mold also consists of two sides: one for producing a small axe called jagwi and the other for two chisels called kkeul. The hook matrix attaching a hook called jochim or naksibaneul and needles called baneul or chim. The frames of the hook and needles for this particular mold must not have been used at all for there are no burnt traces around the frames. In contrast, the frame for a coffer axe has some burnt tracks around it. 5) Bronze Hatchet and Hook Mold. This is also supposed to have been used in manufacturing a small sized knife. It consists of two faces, and the size of one face is 11.93cm in width, 7.05cm in length, and 2.17cm in height. The back of one of the faces also produced a pair of hooks and two isolated hooks. The back of the other face, had it been completed, would have made a mirror frame having fine comb patterns called danyusemungyeong. The failure to make mirrors having fine comb patterns has many experts believe that this mold must have been used in producing copper axes called dongbu.

The bronze hatchet and chisel mold also consists of two sides: one for producing a small axe called jagwi and the other for two chisels called kkeul. The hook matrix attached to both sides of the frame was also used for making needles. 7) Bronze Dagger and Spear Mold. There is only one face. One one side of the face, the mold made copper spears called dongmo and the other side produced knives made of coffer and having many fine comb patterns. It is 20.2cm wide, 7.45cm long and 2.43cm high) Bronze Dagger, Spear and Needle Mold. This must have been used in manufacturing sehyeong donggeom yongbeom, coffer knives having soft comb patterns on one face and in making frames for producing needles, chimyongbeom, and copper spears, dongsa or cheongdongchang. These molds were made of steatite and regarded as one of the most precious molds discovered in Korea."

        "context": "Produced during the Unified Silla Era, this jar is made out of a darkish pencil stone. Its total height, including the lid, is 14.5cm. The height of the body (without the lid) is 12cm, 9cm in diameter on top and 8cm on the bottom. Discovered inside a support stone in the center of a stone Buddha, it has since then been in residence for months and years inside a monk's cell located in a rocky valley of Jirisan Mountain in Gyeongsangnam-do Province. Some of its features include: 1. Enclosing of a projection rather thick than the body around the mouth, a sense of stability from the flat and wide base of non-hoof. 2. Two horizontal lines carved just below the jar's muzzle, middle of the body, and midway between the middle of the body and the bottom. 3. On top of the lid are two lines that form a circle and in the inner center is an engraving of a lotus flower. On the image of the Vairocana Buddha, a record of the jar's production is inscribed. Written in 15 lines of verse, the record concretely says that the jar was made during the second year of Yeongtae, or the second year of King Hyegong's reign (A.D. 766). This inscription has contributed much to understanding when this jar was manufactured: the 8th century, much earlier than it was originally thought. Interpretation of the 15 lines of the verse is somewhat flexible for some of the carved letters were written irregularly. According to experts, though the inscription is difficult to read, the general understanding of the verses is that it was used to console the souls of the dead and promote prosperity and adversity to all mankind. Though a box with paper reduced to ashes (at the time of digging) was discovered, the Jar is regarded as the first discovery of a reliquary in a support stone of a Budda statue in Korea. Therefore, the Jar is regarded as precious historical evidence concerning the study of Buddhism and art history. For the former, it is based on lying in state of Sarira--the terms of its manufacture and its reasons. The latter is on the basis of the skills related to writing the letters, the technology used in manufacturing the lid, the materials used, and the overall work."

This book had been kept in Japan until it was retuned recently to Korea. Besides the damage found in several places caused by excessive humidity, it is preserved in a relatively good condition. In particular, because the painting titled Haengwonpum byeonsang mungyeonghwa found on the back of the summary painting reveals the name of the artist who produced it, this book provides valuable information on the Buddhist art of the ancient Goryeo Period."

Columns and pillars are carved on all sides of the brood foundation. The bodies and roofs are made of separate stones. The roofs, which are rather thin and flat, are remarkably upturned at the corners. All the roofs have five-stepped cornices. Only the base remains of the ornamental top portion, or the final and marks on the corners of the eaves suggest that wind-bells hung there. The pagoda is noted for the carving of door shapes on the first story, each of which is flanked by images of Vajradhara, the guardian deity of Buddhism, which appeared for the first time in the first half of the 8th century.

With its calligrapher's autograph and seal, we have no doubt that this is a genuine piece of Anpyeongdaegun's writing, the valuable and unique one of his own writing that has been found in Korea."

        "context": "His calligraphic scroll Sowon hwagaecheop was written by Anpyeong daegun (1418 ~1453), the third royal prince of King Sejong, the forth ruler of Joseon Dynasty. Anpyeongdaegun was the most celebrated prince for being generous and intelligent who liked to study from early childhood and good at writing poems, calligraphy, and painting as well. But having been involved in the struggle for political power, he was unfairly sacrificed at his young age 36. After his death, most of his artwork was set on fire, and the only thing that still remains in Korea is this calligraphic scroll Sowonhwagaecheop including the penmanship calligraphy and epigraphy. The other piece of his work, The Epilogue to Fairy Land in Dream, is being kept at Tenri University in Japan. This calligraphic scroll (16.5cm x26.5cm) contains 56 words written by Chinese character in a flowing rounded style.

        "context": "This is the portrait of Song Si-yeol (pen-name: Uam) (1607~1689), the representative Neo-Confucian scholar as well as a politician during the middle period of the Joseon Dynasty. As a disciple of Kim Jangsaeng, Song Si-yeol was a talented and prominent writer whose writing style was logical and vigorous. He devoted himself to the study of Chu Hsi and chose to be the successor of Yi I (pen-name: Yulgok; 1536~84) who emphasized the principle of the energizing element called gi, rather than Yi Hwang (pen-name: Toegye, 1501-70) who stressed the importance of the principle called I, which he believed governs human nature and behavior. After going through several government positions, he finally rose to the highest level of vice prime minister. However, after repeated rustication, reappointment, and exile, the saint, being involved in the fight of political faction, was bestowed unfair death-penalty poison from the king. This portrait of Song Si-yeol (56,5cm x 97cm) was drawn showing only upper half on silk fabrics, with the face turning right, dressed in ordinary clothes with broad sleeves that the Confucians used to wear. Wearing the black hood on his head, he maintains dignity with heavy mustache and long silver-gray bushy beard. Saint Song Si-yeol reveals a strong image as a scholar of his profound knowledge, with his emphasized massive figure, strong eye-brows, and deeply lined cheekbones. His face was painted in light color first, then the furrowed lines were drawn in brown, and the wrinkles of the clothes were expressed simply by the curved lines. On the right side, there is a comment with his writing and on the upper part, complimentary remarks made by King Jeongjo. After his death, many a shrine and Confucian Academy have been set up to look back upon the memory of him with respect and affection. Among 5-pieced works that still remain, this portrait is considered as the most valuable one."

According to what is legible, Silla, which was expanding its territory at that time, incorporated the Uljin area into its new territory despite the local residents' objection. The forcible occupation gave rise to a rebellion. Silla convened the Council of Six Districts to address the revolt and dispatched a commander to punish the rebels and erected this monument to prevent any further trouble.

        "context": "Daebojeokgyeong is a collection of various scriptures in Mahayanist Buddhism, which stresses that through various forms of ascetic practices a Buddhist saint will be able to grasp the teaching of Buddha and become enlightened to finally become a Buddha. This is Book No. 59 among the 120 books translated by Pu Di Liu Zhi and 17 others during the Tang Dynasty of China. It is a part of the Tripitaka Original, which was made during the reign of King Hyeonjong (1011~1031) of the Goryeo Period in an attempt to counter an aggression by Kitan on the strength of Buddha. This book is produced by woodblock printing on mulberry papers joined together in a row and designed to be stored in the form of a scroll. Each page is 47cm long and 30cm wide. There are several differences between the Tripitaka Original and the Tripitaka at Haeinsa Temple (also known as the Tripitaka Second or the Tripitaka Koreana), which were produced later. The former has more sophisticatedly carved woodblocks than the latter. It has a different number of characters, while not showing the year of production.

        "context": "These are pictures of Changdeokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace, which are located at the east side of the main palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace. The two pictures are under the title Donggwoldo, or the Picture of the East Palace. Considering the maintenance of the structures in the pictures and the reconstruction date of some of them, supposedly the pictures were painted between 1826 and 1831, during the reign of King Sunjo. It is likely that the painters at Dohwaseo, the Office of Drawings and Paintings, drew them. They are 576cm wide and 273cm long and made into sixteen fold screens. The main perspective is from the right angle, looking downwards. The arbors and bridges of the two palaces, surrounded by mountains and hills, the garden arrangements including the lotus flowers and rocks as well as the walls are all depicted realistically to minute details. The mountains and hills in the background are painted in the manner of Namjonghwa, one of the two schools in Chinese painting. However, the painting mode of the palaces and the way the distance is controlled seem to reveal the influence of western painting. The two pictures show the same mode of expression, technique, and are of the same size. The only difference is that one is painted in colors and has the name of the palace painted on in black characters. These two pictures have more value in the study of palace structures than as mere paintings. The placement of structures and the surrounding scenes are visualized more vividly than the floor plans such as the main royal palaces and the palace for the crown prince. They are important materials in historical researches."

The main idea in this Buddhist scripture is that the Buddha and all other living things are not two different entities, but one. Along with the Lotus Sutra, this principal scripture of the Avatamsaka Sutra is one of the books that have the greatest influence in the establishment of Korean Buddhist philosophy. This is Book No. 1 among the 80 books translated by Sikṣānanda of the Tang Dynasty of China. It is a part of the Tripitaka Original, which was made during the reign of King Hyeonjong (1011-1031) of the Goryeo Period in an attempt to counter an aggression by Kitan on the strength of Buddha. This book is produced by woodblock printing on mulberry papers joined together in a row and designed to be stored in the form of a scroll. The scroll is 1223.5cm long and 28.5cm wide. There are several differences between the Tripitaka Original and the Tripitaka at Haeinsa Temple (also known as the Tripitaka Second or the Tripitaka Koreana), which were produced later. The former has more sophisticatedly carved woodblocks than the latter. It has a different number of characters, while not showing the year of production. Respect is expressed by omitting a stroke from the letter or replacing it with a synonymous word when a letter in the name of the preceding king appears, and abbreviated characters are found in several places. In addition, the Tripitaka Original often uses the words 'jang (丈)' and 'pok (幅)' to indicate the chapters in the books, whereas the Haeinsa Temple version uses a uniform expression of 'jang (張)' (using a different Chinese character). In this book, a stroke is omitted from all Chinese characters that are pronounced 'gyeong (敬)'. The chapters are expressed in terms of 'jang (丈)'. The number of characters in each chapter is only fourteen in a total of 23 lines as compared to seventeen in 24 lines in the Haeinsa Temple version. There is no indication for the year of production.

Along with the Lotus Sutra, this principal scripture of the Avatamsaka Sutra is one of the books that have the greatest influence in the establishment of Korean Buddhist philosophy. This is Book No. 1 among the 80 books translated by Sikṣānanda of the Tang Dynasty of China. It is a part of the Tripitaka Original, which was made during the reign of King Hyeonjong (1011-1031) of the Goryeo Period in an attempt to counter an aggression by Kitan on the strength of Buddha. This book is produced by woodblock printing on mulberry papers joined together in a row and designed to be stored in the form of a scroll. The scroll is 1223.5cm long and 28.5cm wide. There are several differences between the Tripitaka Original and the Tripitaka at Haeinsa Temple (also known as the Tripitaka Second or the Tripitaka Koreana), which were produced later. The former has more sophisticatedly carved woodblocks than the latter. It has a different number of characters, while not showing the year of production. Respect is expressed by omitting a stroke from the letter or replacing it with a synonymous word when a letter in the name of the preceding king appears, and abbreviated characters are found in several places. In addition, the Tripitaka Original often uses the words 'jang (丈)' and 'pok (幅)' to indicate the chapters in the books, whereas the Haeinsa Temple version uses a uniform expression of 'jang (張)' (using a different Chinese character). In this book, a stroke is omitted from all Chinese characters that are pronounced 'gyeong (敬)'. The chapters are expressed in terms of 'jang (丈)'. The number of characters in each chapter is only fourteen in a total of 23 lines as compared to seventeen in 24 lines in the Haeinsa Temple version. There is no indication for the year of production. All these are typical characteristics of the Tripitaka Original. This is the only copy of Book 1 of The First Edition of the Daebanggwangbul Avatamsaka Sutra discovered in Korea, thus providing valuable information in understanding the form of the Tripitaka Original printed in the 11th century."

        "context": "This is an outdoors bottle designed in the late fifteenth century Joseon Dynasty. It is typically used for carrying water or liquors. Because it has a shape of a turtle, it is called ‘Turtle-shaped Bottle’. It is 9.4cm high and 24.1cm wide. All around the bottle, thick white clay is applied. Peony blossoms and leaves are painted in free and open manners with simple brush strokes. Some parts of the surfaces are cut out and painted in black, in order to bring out contrasting light and shade. This design technique is called bakji, a method of design by sgraffiato. Pots designed using this technique stylishly represent the buncheong glazed stonewares. The footplate is low, and a vine pattern band is painted along the edge of it. The glaze color is a bright grayish blue, but the bottom part of the bottle is oxidized to form discoloration. The use of bakji and the colorimetric of black and white are in harmony, characterizing this era."

This monument is in almost the same style as Goguryeo Commemorative Stone in Chungju (National Treasure No. 205) and Silla Stone Monument in Bongpyeong-ri, Uljin-gun (National Treasure No. 242) in terms of shape and calligraphic work. This monument records the property owned by a person named Jeolgeori and inheritance settlement for his descendants. Aristocrats from each district participated in the settlement process, illustrating the limit of royal authority of the period. The monument also depicts the scene of offering a cow in sacrifice to heaven, vividly displaying the customs of the period. The state-erected monument also shows the earlier form of the code of administrative law. Judging from the inscription which contains the characters for the term ‘gyemi’ (one of the years comprising the sexagenarian cycle) and various titles including King Jijeung, this monument seems to have been built in 503, the fourth year of the reign of the king. This monument provides valuable data for the study of epigraphy as well as various social aspects of the period."

It is a part of the Tripitaka Original, which was made during the reign of King Hyeonjong (1011~1031) of the Goryeo Period in an attempt to counter an aggression by Kitan on the strength of Buddha. The book is produced by woodblock printing on mulberry papers and designed to be stored in the form of a scroll. It is made by joining in a row 26 pieces of papers, each of which is 46.5cm long and 29.5cm wide. There are several differences between the Tripitaka Original and the Tripitaka at Haeinsa Temple (also known as the Tripitaka Second or the Tripitaka Koreana), which were produced later. The former has more sophisticatedly carved wood blocks than the latter. It has a different number of characters, while not showing the year of production. Respect is expressed by omitting a stroke from the letter or replacing it with a synonymous word when a letter in the name of the preceding king appears, and abbreviated characters are found in several places. In addition, the Tripitaka Original often uses the words 'jang (丈)' and 'pok (幅)' to indicate the chapters in the books, whereas the Haeinsa Temple version uses a uniform expression of 'jang (張)' (using a different Chinese character). Although an omission of a stroke is not observed in this book, the year of production is not found. The book has is 23 lines of 14 characters, where as Haeinsa Temple version contains 24 lines. The chapters are expressed in terms of 'jang (丈)'. All these confirm the characteristics of the Tripitaka Original. The condition of the printing as well as the quality of the papers tells that it made around the 12th century."

This is the distinguishing design of the water dropper of the era. Two monkeys' fingers and toes are detailed by noticeable grooves. The eyes and nose of the monkeys are also detailed with dotted black paint. The half-standing, half-sitting position of the mother monkey and the fretful baby monkey's depiction shows the maternal and filial affection in a humorous way. The well-finished glazing is transparent, with evenly spread tiny air bubbles, making the object seen dim. The surface color is a beautiful jade green. Monkey shaped porcelain water droppers from the Goryeo Period are rare, and especially the depiction of mother and child figures is outstanding. Goryeo aristocrats imported monkeys as pets during that time period. The suspected pet owner of that time did a superb job.

This is Book No. 36 among the 80 books of the original edition of Avatamsaka Sutra translated by Sikṣānanda of the Tang Dynasty of China.

This book is produced by woodblock printing on mulberry papers and designed to be stored in the form of a scroll. It is made by joining in a row seventeen pieces of papers, each of which is 891cm long and 28.5cm wide. There are several differences between the Tripitaka Original and the Tripitaka at Haeinsa Temple (also known as the Tripitaka Second or the Tripitaka Koreana), which were produced much later.

Respect is expressed by omitting a stroke from the letter or replacing it with a synonymous word when a letter in the name of the preceding king appears, and abbreviated characters are found in several places. In addition, the Tripitaka Original often uses the words 'jang (丈)' and 'pok (幅)' to indicate the chapters in the books, whereas the Haeinsa Temple version uses a uniform expression of 'jang (張)' (using a different Chinese character). In this book, a stroke is omitted from all Chinese characters that are pronounced 'gyeong (敬)'. The chapters are expressed in terms of 'jang (丈)'. The number of characters in a line is only fourteen, not seventeen as in the case of the Haeinsa Temple version.

The former has more sophisticatedly carved wood blocks than the latter. It has a different number of characters, while not showing the year of production. Respect is expressed by omitting a stroke from the letter or replacing it with a synonymous word when a letter in the name of the preceding king appears, and abbreviated characters are found in several places. In addition, the Tripitaka Original often uses the words 'jang (丈)' and 'pok (幅)' to indicate the chapters in the books, whereas the Haeinsa Temple version uses a uniform expression of 'jang (張)' (using a different Chinese character). In this book, a stroke is omitted from all Chinese characters that are pronounced 'gyeong (敬)'. The chapters are expressed in terms of 'jang (丈)'. The number of characters in a line is only fourteen, not seventeen as in the case of the Haeinsa Temple version. A stroke is omitted from all Chinese characters that are pronounced 'gyeong (敬)', the first letter in the preceding king's name. All these imply that this book is a woodblock print of the Tripitaka Original. The condition of the printing as well as the quality of the papers suggests this book is published sometime between the 11th and 12th century, during the reign of King Hyeonjong of the Goryeo Period."

The temple had been destroyed by fire during the Japanese Invasion in 1592 and was rebuilt in 1945. It was not until 1990s that many relics were found from within the Wooden Amitabha Buddha enshrined in Daeungjeon Hall or the main building. The documents found with the relics revealed that the Wooden Amitabha Buddha was made in 1458 during the reign of King Sejo of Joseon as the Principal Buddha of the Buddha Triad of Beopcheonsa Temple. Consistent with this record is the style shown in the topknot and the clothes folds near the arms and stomach, which is typical in the earlier Joseon Dynasty. The location of the Beopcheonsa Temple, however, is unclear because many temples existed there with the same name in many regions including Gyeonggi-do, Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do. The relics in all are fourteen pieces of seven kinds including some Buddhist amulets, Bulsangjoseonggwongomun recording the list of donors and information of this Buddha image and Buljosamgyeonghapbu, a compilation of sutras. The contents found within the body are in accordance with the record of Josanggyeong, which was published by Yujeomsa Temple in 1824: Thirty-eight kinds of fabrics, five kinds of perfumery, five cereals and the Seven Treasures such as glass, pearl, amber, etc. These relics, revealing the production date of the Wooden Amitabha Buddha, are precious themselves especially for textiles and bibliographical research."

        "context": "Daebanya baramildagyeong is often called Daebanyagyeong or simply Banyagyeong in a shortened form. The main idea in this Buddhist scripture is emptiness, a thought that one should get rid of obsession because there is no substance in a being itself. This scripture is often called Banyagyeong in Korea and chanted by every Buddhist regardless of his or her sect. These books are a part of the Tripitaka Original, which was made during the reign of King Hyeonjong (1011~1031) of the Goryeo Period in an attempt to counter an aggression by Kitan on the strength of Buddha. They consist of Books No. 162, 170 and 463 among the six hundred books of Daebanyagyeong translated by Hyeonjang, a famous monk during the Tang Dynasty of China. All three books were produced by woodblock printing on mulberry papers and designed to be stored in the form of a scroll. The writing at the end of Book No. 162 tells that the books were printed by Heo Jin-su in the twelfth year of King Jeongjong of Goryeo in 1046 A.D., with a prayer for the well-being of the king and his country as well as for his own mother's health and longevity and the deceased father's soul. In general, there are several differences between the Tripitaka Original and the Tripitaka stored at Haeinsa Temple (also known as the Tripitaka Second or the Tripitaka Koreana), which were produced in the later years. The former has more sophisticatedly carved wood blocks than the latter. It has a different number of characters, while not showing the year of production. Pihwi, a way of expressing respect by omitting a stroke from the letter or replacing it with a synonymous word when a letter in the name of the preceding king appears, and abbreviated characters, are found in several places. In addition, the Tripitaka Original often uses the words 'jang (丈)' and 'pok (幅) ' to indicate the chapters in the books, whereas the Haeinsa Temple version uses a uniform expression of 'jang (張)' (using a different Chinese character). Each of the books shown here has 25 lines of 14 characters, where as Haeinsa Temple version contains only 23 lines. They have no entry indicating the year the wood-block prints were made. The same state of preservation implies that the three books are printed at the similar time periods. In particular, the content of Book 162 provides an important clue in estimating the time of production for the other two."

The sarira reliquary has a half cylinder shaped roof and a flat base. Inside is tunnel shaped. It is recognized to have a safety system and a door.

This pagoda consists of five stories, a single-tier foundation and some of the final. The foundation had been buried in the ground before it was dismantled and restored to the present shape in 1965. At each corners of the foundation is installed an octagonal corner stone serving as a corner column, between which long, square stones are piled up in imitation of wooden pagodas. The inside of the columns and stones is filled with earth, in which fragments of Baekje roof tiles are discovered. During the 1965 repair work, a sarira container was retrieved inside the base and the roof of the first story. The repair work also revealed a new fact that two central pillars are carved on each side of the foundation. Each story has a column at all corners, and the first story has two central pillars engraved on all sides. The thin, flat roofs are slightly upturned at the corners. The marks on the corners of the eaves suggest that wind-bells hung there. Each roof has a supporting stone on its top to hold the superstructure. Of the final, a stone base, an upside-down alms bowl, an upward-looking flower and a partly broken ring remain. The roofs retain characteristics of Baekje pagodas to some extent, which led to a controversy over the exact date of the pagoda's construction. Judging from the composition style of the foundation and the retrieved sarira container, this pagoda seems to have been the work of early Goryeo, which combines the styles of both Baekje and Silla pagodas.

The Hanging Painting at Cheoljangsa Temple was painted by Beophyeong in 1628, the sixth year of King Injo. It was rolled in papers without being put in a box and preserved in the Daeungjeon Hall. It is 659.5cm long and 398.3cm wide and divided into three sections; upper, middle and low. The section divisions are marked by clouds. The upper section holds the images of the three Buddhas. The image of the Buddha of Enlightenment is in the middle and the image of Sakyamuni and Nosanabul stands at his both sides. In the middle section there are many Bodhisattvas including the image of Yaksabul and Amitabha, and also images of heavenly guardians such as the Four Guardian Kings. The images of Yaksabul and Amitabha, along with the image of Sakyamuni in the upper section represent the three Buddhas of the past, present and future. Dosolcheongung Palace, the ideal world of Buddhism, located at the summit of Sumisan Mountain, is painted in the center of the lower section. There are two Bodhisattvas, Avalokitesvara or the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, at the sides. Avalokitesvara is sitting on a fantastically shaped rock. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is the supreme god of hell. Under the Dosolcheongung Palace, a worshipping crowd can be seen. The arrangement into the above three sections has a purpose. It is intended to enlighten the minds of the worshippers through the world of the image of the three Buddhas and the three Buddhas of the past, present and future, and to tell them they can reach Dosolcheongung Palace through the salvation of Avalokitesvara and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. The hanging painting is mostly in green. The contrast between orange yellow and ocher gives the whole picture a rather heavy mood, but the red clothes balance it off. The sophisticated figures and well-wrought structure, delicate touches of the brush make this painting a representative work of the period.

        "context": "Gwaebul is a large Buddhist painting that is hung at the front garden of the sanctuary during sermons or ceremonies. The Hanging Painting at Cheoljangsa Temple was painted by Beophyeong in 1628, the sixth year of King Injo. It was rolled in papers without being put in a box and preserved in the Daeungjeon Hall. It is 659.5cm long and 398.3cm wide and divided into three sections; upper, middle and low. The section divisions are marked by clouds. The upper section holds the images of the three Buddhas. The image of the Buddha of Enlightenment is in the middle and the image of Sakyamuni and Nosanabul stands at his both sides. In the middle section there are many Bodhisattvas including the image of Yaksabul and Amitabha, and also images of heavenly guardians such as the Four Guardian Kings. The images of Yaksabul and Amitabha, along with the image of Sakyamuni in the upper section represent the three Buddhas of the past, present and future. Dosolcheongung Palace, the ideal world of Buddhism, located at the summit of Sumisan Mountain, is painted in the center of the lower section. There are two Bodhisattvas, Avalokitesvara or the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, at the sides. Avalokitesvara is sitting on a fantastically shaped rock. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is the supreme god of hell. Under the Dosolcheongung Palace, a worshipping crowd can be seen. The arrangement into the above three sections has a purpose. It is intended to enlighten the minds of the worshippers through the world of the image of the three Buddhas and the three Buddhas of the past, present and future, and to tell them they can reach Dosolcheongung Palace through the salvation of Avalokitesvara and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. The hanging painting is mostly in green. The contrast between orange yellow and ocher gives the whole picture a rather heavy mood, but the red clothes balance it off. The sophisticated figures and well-wrought structure, delicate touches of the brush make this painting a representative work of the period. It is regarded significant in the study of early 17th century Buddhist paintings."

With the image of Sakyamuni at the center, many Bodhisattvas, including Manjusri Bodhisattva and Bodhisattva of Karuna and the heavenly guardians of Sakyamuni, such as the Four Guardian Kings, are depicted. Sakyamuni has draped on his right shoulder a long gown. He is pointing down the ground with his fingers, which means that the demons are put off. He sits in the center with his fingers arranged this way. His arms and hands are rather long and in this aspect his figure is not so refined. However, his rather angled face and strong features gives his face an austere look and the overall proportion of the body is well proportioned. The flower print highlights the image of Sakyamuni. The things depicted around Sakyamuni get smaller as it gets higher and engenders a feeling of ascension. Red and green are the two main colors used. The colors are painted on rather thickly and there are parts that show signs of too much paint. This increases the opacity. The rather rectangular shape of Sakyamuni's nimbus and face engenders a look of austerity. Compared to other hanging paintings, the number of bodhisattvas is reduced and the figures of the Four Guardian Kings are much larger. This hanging painting was made three years after those at Bosalsa Temple in Cheongju were finished. Still there are many similarities, and along with the hanging painting at Bosalsa, this Gwaebul gives much information on the study of Buddhist paintings of Chungcheong area in the mid 17th century."

The Samsinbul, or the three Buddhas, Sakyamuni, Nosanabul with Vairocana Buddha in the middle, preaching truth is the subject of this gwaebul. It is 1,270.4cm long and 887.6cm wide. It is arranged into three sections; upper, middle, and low. In the upper section there are the images of Avalokitesvara, Bodhisattva of Power, Buddha's disciples and guardian deities. The Samsinbuls are in the middle and the images of Manjusri Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva of Karuna, the Four Guardian Kings and Sarira Buddha are in the lower section. Vairocana Buddha or Buddha of Enlightenment in the middle has a nimbus behind his back and has a round face. He is cloaked in clothes covering his shoulders and holds his right hand in his left hand.

Middle tone colors, such as green, red, yellow and the golden color lighten up the whole picture. This gwaebul is unique in that it emphasizes the Samsinbuls in the middle.

There are four images of Buddhas to the right and left side. It is written in Chinese character, in the aura ‘Wonmanbosin nosanabul’. The hands are rather large for the body and the palms are lifted upwards in the position of preaching, or in the shape of seolbeobin. The clothes are painted in green, red and pink. The surroundings are painted in 5 colors representing light. To the right and left side of Nosanabul, the head bodhisattva, are the ten Bodhisattvas. The ten Bodhisattvas can be identified through the things they carry and the color of their clothes. The ten disciples above the ten Bodhisattvas are depicted in detail. The direction their faces are looking to, the expression on their faces, their clothes and belongings are all drawn with care. This gwaebul is a representative Buddhist painting of the 17th century that is well-wrought in terms of structure, delicate in expression and various in the use of colors."

There are four images of Buddhas to the right and left side. It is written in Chinese character, in the aura ‘Wonmanbosin nosanabul’. The hands are rather large for the body and the palms are lifted upwards in the position of preaching, or in the shape of seolbeobin. The clothes are painted in green, red and pink. The surroundings are painted in 5 colors representing light. To the right and left side of Nosanabul, the head bodhisattva, are the ten Bodhisattvas. The ten Bodhisattvas can be identified through the things they carry and the color of their clothes. The ten disciples above the ten Bodhisattvas are depicted in detail. The direction their faces are looking to, the expression on their faces, their clothes and belongings are all drawn with care. This gwaebul is a representative Buddhist painting of the 17th century that is well-wrought in terms of structure, delicate in expression and various in the use of colors."

The image of Maitreya is in the center and the images of six Buddhas and six Bodhisattvas fill the picture. It is said that after 5,670,000,000 years has passed from the time Sakyamuni entered nirvana, he will come back to the human world in the shape of Maitreya and save the people. Maitreya has a rectangular face and is wearing a splendidly wrought crown on his head. The crown has images of four Buddhas. He is also holding a branch of yonghwasu in full bloom. He is full in shape and has a quite large upper body and long arms. Vairocana Buddha and Nosanabul, each at this left and right side, have round auras around their heads. The former has his fingers pointing downwards in the figure of jigwonin, and the latter has his palms lifted upwards in the shape of preaching. Other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas carry things that represent them and the ten disciples have their palms clasped together in the shape of worship.

All the figures are slim and well balanced and painted in bright, vivid colors. All these features, including the splendid flower print, are characteristics of the 17th century Buddhist painting. This gwaebul is an excellent example of 17th century Buddhist painting and is also preserved in a favorable state."

        "context": "Gwaebul is a large Buddhist painting that is hung at the front garden of the sanctuary during sermons or ceremonies. This particular gwaebul is Yeongsan hoesangdo, which depicts the scene of Sakyamuni preaching. It was painted in 1722 by monk painters and Uigyeom was one of them. It is 10.22m long and 6.35m wide. Sakyamuni, the head Buddha, has a rather short upper body but is still stately and majestic. He is standing in the center. He has a round face and a corpulent body. This means that this image of Sakyamuni was drawn according to the tradition of the Yeongsan hoesangdo in Palsangjeon Hall, Ssanggyesa Temple. His Buddhist apparel draped over his shoulders is dignified and they drastically reveal his chest. This apparel is painted in red and green. The lapels vary in degrees and the flower print at the front is bright and vivid. The two Bodhisattvas next to Sakyamuni seem to be Munsubosal and Bohyeonbosal. They are holding lotus flowers. They are a bit smaller than Sakyamuni and are wearing splendid crowns. They have round faces and are facing the front. They are located behind Sakyamuni to create a sense of distance. Various colors, such as azure, blue, light pink, are used and the complicated flower print and the ornaments show of the Bodhisattvas. On the head of the Bodhisattvas the figures of Sakyamuni's disciples, Anan and Gaseop, and other images of Buddhas are painted. This picture seems to belong to the early 18th century, considering the arrangement of the Buddhas, their figurations, colors and prints. It can be compared to the gwaebul at Yongmunsa Temple in Yecheon, for they both treat the same subject. The written record alongside the picture tells that Uigyeom participated in it. It is the best among Uigyeom's works and is an invaluable piece of art in the studies of Buddhist paintings."

        "context": "Built in 1598, and used as both a guesthouse for government dignitaries and as a naval headquarters during the Japanese invasions in 1592 and 1597, Jinnamgwan is the largest extant local government building in Korea being 14m high, 75m long and 240-pyeong large (1 pyeong equals 3.3 square meters). This landmark also retains traces of renovation works carried out by Admiral Yi Je-myeon in 1718. Jinnamgwan is supported by 68 large, round pillars, which are arranged and connected with a variety of crossbeams to support the structure in a complicated and scientific way. Those pillars are thicker at the bottom, getting thinner toward the top. The tops of the pillars are finished with elegant plates supporting the roof. From the outside, those plates are adorned with sophisticated lotus buds, especially, the front and corner pillars feature dragon heads on the top. Between the pillars are arranged wooden pieces of boards generating three-dimensional effects. Most part of the structure preserves dancheong (decorative wood carvings with attractive colors and designs) patterns in their original shape. In addition, to enhance space efficiency, the corner pillars are moved a little backward, which makes the interior space look larger. Its simple design and reliable materials add more magnificent touches to the building. Moreover, two supporting beams are placed at either side of the structure to give more stability. Though built in the early 18th Century, Jinnamgwan is highly valued in historic, academic and artistic aspects."

After several renovation works, it still commands its old-time majesty as one of the most grandiose local government buildings overlooking the South Sea. Sebyeonggwan is a majestic one-story building with nine rooms in front and five rooms on the sides. It features exotic roofing called paljak jibung, a hip and gable roof whose curved eaves lead to corners going upwards. The whole structure has a wooden floor on the ground, which is raised about 45cm higher at the center to display royal tablets. Right above the altar stands a red gate with spiked tops. The lower part of the cornice is wainscoted to have a sliding door, while the upper part is finished with a stripe of wood featuring a painting of soldiers, and the ceiling is paneled.

Wangnyeok is a brief chronology of the Three Kingdoms, Garakguk, Later Goguryeo and Later baekje. Gii covers the history from Gojoseon to the late Three Kingdoms Period.

Heungbeop deals with the rise of Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms, while Tapsang covers pagodas and Buddhist images. Uihae provides anecdotes of renowned monks from the Silla period. Sinju tells the story about miracles done by esoteric Buddhism during the Silla period. Gamtong is about tales of devotion, and Pieun portrays legends of reclusive heroes. Lastly, Hyoseon contains folktales of filial piety and Buddhist virtues. Samguk yusa is considered to be an extremely important cultural heritage representing ancient Korean history, geography, literature, religion, language, folklore, art, archeology, etc. First, the book often cites ancient literary works about history, Buddhism and legends, most of which are not presently extant. Second, it presents a rare source for the study of ancient Korean language systems, particularly, 14 pieces of hyangga (old Korean folk songs) are essential in studying classical Korean literature. Third, the book also provides a wealth of information regarding Buddhist art, the mainstream in ancient Korean art history. The Tapsang part, in particular, which mainly focuses on the founding of pagodas, Buddhist images and temples, is an essential source for the study of various remains and relics of both historical and archeological value. Last but not least, the book contains a wide range of records about young soldiers of the Silla Period, which are more religious and poetical than those written in Samguk sagi.

Samguk yusa is considered to be an extremely important cultural heritage representing ancient Korean history, geography, literature, religion, language, folklore, art, archeology, etc. First, the book often cites ancient literary works about history, Buddhism and legends, most of which are not presently extant. Second, it presents a rare source for the study of ancient Korean language systems, particularly, 14 pieces of hyangga (old Korean folk songs) are essential in studying classical Korean literature. Third, the book also provides a wealth of information regarding Buddhist art, the mainstream in ancient Korean art history. The Tapsang part, in particular, which mainly focuses on the founding of pagodas, Buddhist images and temples, is an essential source for the study of various remains and relics of both historical and archeological value. Last but not least, the book contains a wide range of records about young soldiers of the Silla Period, which are more religious and poetical than those written in Samguk sagi. This is the only book that has no missing pages among the Samguk yusa books published in Gyeongju in 1512 (the 7th year of King Jungjong), the edition most widely used by academic scholars. This also is thought to be the earliest edition."

Standing between the two Buddha images, a little smaller in size is the Bodhisattva statue is wearing a coronet, which has no pattern presently but is thought to have had one before. Its oval, plump face is putting on a calm smile, and its cylinder-like body is standing straight. The robe covering the shoulders flows down and crosses around the lap. The two hands are put together upon the stomach holding a sacred bead and the right hand faces up with the left one down. With its lotus pedestal of the Baekje period, Standing Rock-carved Triad Buddha in Taean-gun is recognized as having exceptional sculptural value. Located at a key point for cultural exchange with China, this work of art is also essential in studying the mutual relations with Chinese Buddhist statues. Its formative patterns preceding even those of Rock-carved Buddha Triad in Yonghyeon-ri, Seosan (National Treasure No. 84) assure its historic value as a national treasure and the oldest rock-carved Buddha image of the Baekje period."

The usnisa (a protuberance symbolizing supreme wisdom) is distinct, and the face is round and flat, but graceful. The ears are long and detailed and the formal three wrinkles on the neck represent samdo (the three ways for a Buddhist to go through to attain enlightenment). The body is heavily clothed, but the curves of the body are mostly evident. The volume and posture are balanced. However, the lower body is infirm compared to the upper body because of the cross-legged posture with both feet placed on top of both knees. The right hand on top of the knee looks weak with the hands in the position of fending off evil spirits. A distinctive feature of this Buddha statue is the robe typical of that era. The robe draped over both shoulders looks troublesome because of the outer garments, but it has the same style as the seated iron Vairocana Buddha statue at Dopiansa Temple in Cheorwon (National Treasure No. 63). There is a lot of volume in most of the body, but the proportions are abnormal, and the techniques used are inferiorly. It is believed to have been made during the early Goryeo Period."

Widely admired as a dynasty founder, King Taejo had a total of 26 official portraits enshrined in many parts of his kingdom. Unfortunately, all these portraits have disappeared except the one currently hung in Gyeonggijeon Shrine in Jeonju. Often compared with the official portrait of the founder and first emperor of the Ming Dynasty of China, this portrait captures the full body of King Taejo in a royal robe and winged cap, seated in a chair, facing forward. The angled outlines of the royal robe and its voluminous lower part covering the legs reflect the characteristic style found in the meritorious subjects’ portraits of the early Joseon Dynasty. The tall footrest continued to be used for the Joseon’s royal portraits until that of King Sukjong (r. 1674-1720) while the dragon design decorating the chair traces back to the portrait of King Gongmin of the Goryeo Dynasty and was used for the kings’ portraits until the early Joseon Dynasty. The artist used a shading technique to create a three-dimensional effect for the winged cap as well as the king’s face. This painting is a reproduction made in 1872 (the 9th year of King Gojong’s reign) based on the original, which had worn out with old age.

Although parts of the top and right-hand side of the monument have been lost, it is in good condition overall, and the inscription is clearly legible.The inscription contains details of the development of Silla’s official rank system, the internal structure of Silla’s six bu, local governance and dispute settlement procedures, the significance of the royal palaces, and the imposition of legal measures to prevent the recurrence after passing judgment on a case. As such, the monument constitutes a valuable source of historical and academic information on the politics, economy and culture of Silla.The inscription is engraved in the ornamental seal writing style, which is similar to the older version found on the Monument to King Gwanggaeto the Great, showing Silla’s characteristic ‘frankness’. This monument was erected two years earlier than the Silla Monument in Naengsu-ri, Pohang, which dates from 503 (the 4th year of the reign of King Jijeung)."

The meeting of the association depicted in the paintings took place in 1719, while the album was completed the following year. An association called the Giroso was established to honor the services of elderly civil officials of the second rank (pum) aged over 70.The album consists of an introduction written by Im Bang (1640-1724), a poetic work written by King Sukjong himself at the banquet, which was held at Gyeonghyeondang Hall of Gyeonghuigung Palace, a postscript written by Kim Yu (1653-1719), a roster of the association’s members, paintings depicting the association’s gatherings, half-length portraits of, and poetic works written by, various members, and a list of minor officials who participated in the production of the album. The paintings of the association’s events in the album appear in the following order: Consecration of the King’s Membership Certificate (Eocheop Bongando), which depicts a procession of officials carrying the certificate of King Sukjong’s membership of the Association of the Elder Statesmen from Heungjeongdang Hall of Gyeonghuigung Palace to the office of the association, where it would finally be stored; Royal Banquet at Sungjeongjeon Hall (Sungjeongjeon Jinhajeondo), which portrays a scene of the royal banquet held at Sungjeongjeon Hall of Gyeonghuigung Palace on the day after the procession; King’s Banquet at Gyeonghyeondang Hall (Gyeonghyeondang Seogyeondo), a painting of the banquet hosted by the king at Gyeonghyeondang Hall; Return to the Association with the Royal Cup (Bongbae Gwisado), which depicts a procession of elder statesmen returning to the office of their association with the silver cup awarded to them at the Gyeonghyeondang banquet; and Private Banquet for Retired Elder Statesmen, which portrays a banquet held for the elder statesmen at the office of their association.Produced by Kim Jin-yeo, Jang Tae-heung and other master painters serving at the Office of Charts and Paintings (Dohwaseo), these paintings of the celebratory events and the portraits of the elder statesmen are characterized by the use of bright colors, delicate and well-controlled brush strokes, and a realistic depiction of facial expressions, accompanied by a masterful use of a shading technique. Generally regarded as the greatest court paintings of their kind produced in late eighteenth-century Joseon, they had a strong impact on the court paintings of the later period.

The glaze covering its surface is light green, differing slightly from that of celadon ware proper, while the clay is grayish white, similar to that of porcelain ware.With the form and glaze of the jar shows the strong influence of celadon ware from Yue, one of the Five Great Kilns of the Song dynasty, the jar provides valuable clues about the early phase of Goryeo celadon."

The inscription on the bronze sarira case shows that the reliquary was made in 577 during the reign of King Wideok (r. 554-598) of Baekje. The origins of the temple are recorded in The History of the Three Kingdoms (Samguk sagi, 1145).The sarira bottles of the reliquary display the typically high level of workmanship of Baekje artisans in terms of the techniques used to cast, cut, join and polish them. The vessels are also highly regarded for the delightfully simple and elegant shape of their body, the onion-shaped cintamani knob on their lid, and the lotus motif decoration on their surface. Generally regarded as a masterpiece among the sarira reliquaries of late sixth-century Baekje, this particular reliquary is a valuable link between the Baekje metalcraft represented by the silver cup and saucer excavated at King Muryeong’s tomb built in 525 and that represented by the sarira reliquary excavated from the Mireuksa Temple site, which dates back to the first half of the seventh century."

        "context": "This statue of Monk Huirang, who was active from the late Silla to the early Goryeo period, is the only extant carved representation of an eminent, highly respected monk in the country. It is presumed to have been made in the early tenth century, at a time when many carved images of monks were being made in China and Japan but not on the Korean Peninsula. It is said that Huirang was a scholarly monk who was well versed in the study of Avatamsaka (Hua-yan Sect), stayed at Haeinsa Temple, and helped Wang Geon (later King Taejo, founder of the Goryeo Dynasty) to unify the Later Three Kingdoms.According to records from the Joseon Period, this work was kept at Haeinsa Temple (though it was moved around with the temple, from Haehaengdang Hall to Jinsangjeon Hall, then to Josanjeon Hall, and finally to Bojangjeon Hall) for hundreds of years. Records of scholars’ visits to the temple in the late Joseon period, including The Record of Gayasan Mountain by Yi Deokmu (1741 - 1793), lend credence to the story about it being kept at Haeinsa Temple. Researchers have praised the work for its superb esthetic quality, as well as its value in providing information on the method of its production, including the application of lacquer to its front (i.e. the face, the chest, the hands, and the knees) and back, and the bottom made of assembled lumber. This method of combining the front and rear sides is found in other sculpted images of Buddha made between the late Silla and early Goryeo period, including the Seated Lacquered Medicine Buddha Statue at Cheongnyangsa Temple in Bonghwa (Treasure No. 1919).This particular work features a realistic yet conceptual portrayal of the monk, and differs markedly from other images of highly respected monks such as the Wood-Carved Statue of Monk Naong in Josadang Hall of Silleuksa Temple (1636), the Clay Statue of Monk Euisang in Josadang Hall of Buseoksa Temple (late Goryeo – early Joseon), and the Statue of Monk Yuil in Gagyeonsa, Goesan (late Joseon). Anyone who views this work will have no difficulty imagining how Monk Huirang may have looked in his lifetime, as it presents a slim, compact, full-sized body, a benevolent gaze, a light smile, and a body frame displayed over old and emaciated skin.The piece also has a small hole made in the chest. According to a legend handed down at Haeinsa Temple, the hole was made to let mosquitoes suck blood from it and thereby prevent them obstructing other monks in their ascetic practices, although the making of a hole in the chest of a highly respected monk is also known to symbolize his occult power. A similar example can be seen in the Statue of Monk Seungga (1024; Treasure No. 1000) at Seunggasa Temple, Bukhansan Mountain, Seoul. As mentioned above, this work is thought to be the only surviving image of a highly respected monk backed up by the relevant records, which makes it a rare and precious work of great esthetic quality that attempts to portray an eminent monk, including even his inner personality, in a realistic manner.Monk Huirang contributed greatly to the unification of the Later Three Kingdoms and the development of the study of Buddhism. Considering the historicity of the monk and the techniques used to make the work, which provide valuable information on the period in which it was made, it is a highly precious work of art. As such, it is essential to preserve and manage it with great care and to publicize its value widely by designating it as a national treasure in consideration of its importance in terms of the history of human culture, and its historic, artistic, and academic value as a work that attempts to sublimate the spiritual world of the monk."

Researchers have praised the work for its superb esthetic quality, as well as its value in providing information on the method of its production, including the application of lacquer to its front (i.e. the face, the chest, the hands, and the knees) and back, and the bottom made of assembled lumber. This method of combining the front and rear sides is found in other sculpted images of Buddha made between the late Silla and early Goryeo period, including the Seated Lacquered Medicine Buddha Statue at Cheongnyangsa Temple in Bonghwa (Treasure No. 1919).This particular work features a realistic yet conceptual portrayal of the monk, and differs markedly from other images of highly respected monks such as the Wood-Carved Statue of Monk Naong in Josadang Hall of Silleuksa Temple (1636), the Clay Statue of Monk Euisang in Josadang Hall of Buseoksa Temple (late Goryeo – early Joseon), and the Statue of Monk Yuil in Gagyeonsa, Goesan (late Joseon). Anyone who views this work will have no difficulty imagining how Monk Huirang may have looked in his lifetime, as it presents a slim, compact, full-sized body, a benevolent gaze, a light smile, and a body frame displayed over old and emaciated skin.The piece also has a small hole made in the chest. According to a legend handed down at Haeinsa Temple, the hole was made to let mosquitoes suck blood from it and thereby prevent them obstructing other monks in their ascetic practices, although the making of a hole in the chest of a highly respected monk is also known to symbolize his occult power. A similar example can be seen in the Statue of Monk Seungga (1024; Treasure No. 1000) at Seunggasa Temple, Bukhansan Mountain, Seoul. As mentioned above, this work is thought to be the only surviving image of a highly respected monk backed up by the relevant records, which makes it a rare and precious work of great esthetic quality that attempts to portray an eminent monk, including even his inner personality, in a realistic manner.Monk Huirang contributed greatly to the unification of the Later Three Kingdoms and the development of the study of Buddhism. Considering the historicity of the monk and the techniques used to make the work, which provide valuable information on the period in which it was made, it is a highly precious work of art. As such, it is essential to preserve and manage it with great care and to publicize its value widely by designating it as a national treasure in consideration of its importance in terms of the history of human culture, and its historic, artistic, and academic value as a work that attempts to sublimate the spiritual world of the monk."

        "context": "The Album of the Elder Statesmen’s Association (Gisa Gyecheop) is a collection of paintings made to commemorate the initiation of King Sukjong (r. 1674-1720) into the Association of Elder Statesmen (Giroso) in 1719 when he was 59 old, following the example of the founder of the Joseon dynasty, King Taejo (r. 1392-1398). This commemorative meeting of the association, which was established to honor the services of senior civil officials of the Major 2nd Rank (jeongipum) and above aged 70 or over, took place in 1719, and the album of paintings was completed the following year.  Twelve copies were made in total, of which eleven were distributed to the members of the association while the remaining one was stored at the office of the association. Of the twelve original copies, only five remain today, including the one (National Treasure No. 325) in the collection of the National Museum.Designated as National Treasure No. 334, this album consists of an introduction written by a member of the association named Im Bang (1640-1724), a poetic work written by King Sukjong at the banquet held at Gyeonghyeondang Hall of Gyeonghuigung Palace, a postscript written by Kim Yu (1653-1719), a roster of the eleven association members who participated in the celebratory event, paintings of the celebratory gathering, half-length portraits of, and poetic works written by, various members of the association, and a list of minor officials who participated in the production of the album. This particular copy of the album differs from others due to the inclusion of two calligraphic works, the Mantoedang Hall Collection (晩退堂藏) on pages 1 and 2 and Family Treasure House (傳家寶藏) on pages 53 and 54, which suggest that it was issued to Hong Man-jo (1465-1725), one of the members who participated in the 1719 event. The four-character idioms show that the album was part of the collection of the Pungsan Hong clan. The album is complete with its set of coverings, inner box (naeham), protective case (hogap) and outer case (oegap), which were specially made to protect the paintings. As indispensable parts of the album, these coverings provide tangible clues about the Joseon dynasty’s use of protective cases to preserve valuable items and the craft techniques used to make them.This album of paintings is generally regarded as a valuable historical material due to its direct connection with the historic event of King Sukjong’s initiation into the Association of Elder Statesmen in 1719, and because it was used as a model for King Gojong’s initiation in 1902. Given the abundant documentary evidence of its origin, including the identities of its producers and production dates, coupled with the artistic excellence of the eminent scholar-officials involved in its production, and the excellent condition of its original, superbly crafted protective coverings, this album of paintings is widely regarded as a crucial element of the cultural heritage of the Joseon court."

The collection of artifacts includes a gold plaque inscribed with a prayer honoring the sarira niche and the date of enshrinement (639), a gilt-bronze outer sarira jar and a gold inner sarira jar, precious beads and other offerings to the Buddha.Both sarira jars are designed to be opened by twisting the central part of the body, a unique mechanism rarely seen in other sarira containers made in East Asia. The jars exhibit a voluminous, stable body with elegant curves and intricate decorative designs.The prayer engraved on the thin gold plaque consists of 193 Chinese characters arranged in 11 rows. According to the record, the queen of Baekje , who was also a daughter of Sataekjeokdeok, a high-ranking official (Jwapyeong) of the kingdom, donated a fortune in the Gihae Year (639) to finance the establishment of a Buddhist temple - and the enshrinement of the Buddha’s relics in the temple – as a place to pray for the safety of the royal family of Baekje. The text of the prayer is regarded as a valuable historical and academic artifact as it provides new facts about the founder of the temple and the date of its foundation, supplementing the background history of Mireuksa Temple recorded in the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms (Samguk yusa, 1285).The discovery at the Mireuksa Temple site includes a set of six bronze cases of different sizes. One of the cases is incised with an inscription, Dalsol Mokgeun, indicating a high-ranking Baekje official of the second grade, showing that these vessels, together with other valuable offerings, were donated by a very important Baekje aristocrat. The vessels are highly regarded for their historical and cultural significance as items of finest-quality Baekje tableware as well as for their extreme rarity.As the Sarira Reliquaries of the West Pagoda at the Mireuksa Temple Site in Iksan were produced under the patronage of the royal family of Baekje and discovered in the sarira repository made inside a stone pagoda at the Mireuksa Temple site, where they were wonderfully preserved in their original condition, they are regarded as priceless primary sources and criteria for the study of sarira reliquaries made across East Asia in the early phase of its history. The artifacts are also highly regarded for the advanced craft techniques and high-quality materials used in their production, as well as their outstanding artistic merits in terms of form and ornamentation."
